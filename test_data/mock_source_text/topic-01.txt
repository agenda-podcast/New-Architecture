SCRIPT:
HOST_A (Gary Thompson): From South Brooklyn, I’m Gary Thompson. It is Sunday, December 28, 2025, and if you’re listening while making coffee, or getting kids ready, or staring at a bank app and doing that little mental math thing we all do now, you’re not alone.

HOST_B (Margaret Butcher): I’m Margaret Butcher. And yes, I did the bank-app stare this morning. It’s like a hobby, except it’s not fun and it costs money.

HOST_A: Today we’re talking about the global cost-of-living squeeze, but we’re going to keep it grounded in what people actually pay: housing, food, energy, and the services you can’t opt out of. And we’re going to focus on the U.S. and the U.K., because the story rhymes across both places, even when the details differ.

HOST_B: Before we get into it, I want to set a standard with you, Gary, because “cost of living” gets turned into a political ping-pong match. What are we doing today, and what are we not doing?

HOST_A: Good. Here’s the standard. One: We’re going to separate verified facts from claims and opinions. If it’s from an official statistical agency or a primary release, we’ll say so. Two: We’ll separate the inflation rate from the price level, because those are two different things and people feel the second one every day. Three: We’ll talk about what working families can realistically expect next, not what makes for a good argument online. And four: we’ll end with practical steps that don’t require a finance degree or a miracle.

HOST_B: That’s the most Brooklyn thing you’ve ever said. “Practical steps that don’t require a miracle.”

HOST_A: Listen, I rent. I’ve got three kids. Two cats. Two guinea pigs. I commute from South Brooklyn into Jersey City. I am not living in a spreadsheet. I’m living in a receipt.

HOST_B: Okay. Let’s drop into the data, because people hear “inflation is down” and then they look at rent, groceries, childcare, the subway fare, whatever, and they’re like, “Down where?”

HOST_A: Exactly. In the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, CPI-U, was up 2.7% over the 12 months ending November 2025. That was published December 18, 2025. That’s a verified statistic from BLS. And a key detail this year: the October 2025 CPI wasn’t produced because of the federal government shutdown, so BLS reported the change over the two months from September to November. But the year-over-year number for November is 2.7%. That’s the official figure. And when people hear 2.7%, they think, “So we’re basically back to normal.”

HOST_B: But “normal” is doing a lot of work there.

HOST_A: Right. Because if prices went up a lot in the last few years, slowing the rate of increase doesn’t bring prices back down. It just means they’re rising more slowly from a higher base.

HOST_B: So the treadmill is slower, but you’re still running.

HOST_A: Exactly. Now, in the U.K., the Office for National Statistics reported that CPI inflation was 3.2% in the 12 months to November 2025, down from 3.6% in October. That release was December 17, 2025. Verified. Official. So, U.S. 2.7% year over year in November, U.K. 3.2% year over year in November.

HOST_B: Those numbers don’t sound like emergency-level inflation. But the vibe in both places is still anxious. In the U.S., consumer confidence dropped again in December. The Conference Board index fell to 89.1 in December from 92.9 in November, per the Conference Board’s December 23, 2025 release. And that’s not a price index, but it’s a signal of how people feel.

HOST_A: And how people feel matters, because feelings turn into spending behavior, and spending behavior turns into the economy. But I want to be careful: confidence is not proof that prices are rising faster; it’s proof people are still stressed about budgets, jobs, and the future.

HOST_B: Fine. But the cynic’s take is: consumers always say they feel bad, and then they still spend.

HOST_A: Sometimes they do. But the Reuters reporting in the U.K. is useful here: on December 22, 2025, Reuters covered ONS data showing the U.K. economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter of 2025, and that households’ saving ratio fell to 9.5%, the lowest in over a year. That’s not just “vibes.” That’s behavior: saving less, spending carefully, and getting squeezed by taxes and prices.

HOST_B: And saving less can be a warning sign. If you’re spending the same but saving less, you’re not suddenly rich. You’re covering the same life with less cushion.

HOST_A: That’s it. Now, let’s talk about what actually squeezes people. In both the U.S. and the U.K., it comes down to the big four: housing, food, energy, and services. Housing is the monster category for most households. And it’s the one that doesn’t feel like it’s coming down, even when inflation cools.

HOST_B: Let’s start with the U.S. housing piece, because the story isn’t just “rent is high.” It’s “rent is high and buying is also high,” which traps people.

HOST_A: Right. And for rents, we do have recent national indicators. Zillow’s November 2025 rental report, published December 18, 2025, said the typical asking rent was $1,925 in November, down 0.3% month over month, and up 2.2% year over year. It also noted concessions were common: 39.3% of listings had a concession.

HOST_B: Concessions meaning, “First month free,” “Reduced deposit,” “We’ll waive the amenity fee,” that kind of thing.

HOST_A: Exactly. And here’s why that matters to working families: even if the sticker rent looks flat, the actual deal you can negotiate might be better than it was a year ago, depending on your market. That’s not a promise. That’s a possibility, supported by that concessions share.

HOST_B: Let me be the skeptic. If the “typical” asking rent is $1,925, that sounds like a national average that doesn’t mean much to a renter in New York City or London. People hear national averages and they roll their eyes.

HOST_A: Fair. A national number is not your neighborhood. I pay New York prices. I know. But national indicators still tell you directionally whether the market is loosening or tightening. And the big picture in the U.S. is: rent growth cooled compared to the worst of it, but rents remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic years. That part is a claim based on the long-run context, not a single monthly data point, but it’s consistent with the reality renters feel.

HOST_B: Now the U.K. rent picture. What do we have that’s official?

HOST_A: The ONS “Private rent and house prices” bulletin released December 17, 2025 reports that average UK monthly private rents increased 4.4% in the 12 months to November 2025, to £1,366. Verified, official.

HOST_B: So even with inflation easing, rent is still rising faster than the headline inflation rate in the U.K., at least on that measure.

HOST_A: It can, yes. And this is where people get angry when told “inflation is falling.” They’re like, “Okay, but my landlord didn’t get that memo.”

HOST_B: Or my letting agent. Or the renewal email with the smiley face. Nothing makes me see red like “Just checking in!” when it’s a rent increase.

HOST_A: Exactly. And it’s not just rent. It’s the cost of financing housing. The U.K. has had a run of high rates and then cuts. The Bank of England cut Bank Rate to 3.75% at the meeting ending December 17, 2025, with the decision published December 18, 2025. That’s official from the BoE. That helps borrowers over time, but it doesn’t instantly reset every household budget.

HOST_B: And in the BoE minutes, they’re basically saying: inflation is still above target at 3.2% CPI in November, but they expect it to fall back toward target more quickly near term, and they see slack building in the labor market. That’s their rationale for easing.

HOST_A: Right. But you and I know how this lands in real life. If you’re refinancing next month, you care a lot. If you’re a renter whose landlord is still trying to cover higher mortgage costs, you might not see the benefit for a while. If you’re a first-time buyer, lower rates can help, but prices and supply are still the choke points.

HOST_B: Okay. That’s housing. Now energy, because the energy story is different in the U.S. and the U.K. but it hits everyone.

HOST_A: In the U.K., the energy price cap is a huge anchor for households on default tariffs. Ofgem’s announcement about the cap for January 1 through March 31, 2026 sets a typical annual bill at £1,758 for a dual-fuel household paying by Direct Debit, up 0.2% from the previous cap level. That’s per Ofgem’s November 21, 2025 release about the cap change.

HOST_B: So: small increase, but the important part is the level stays high relative to pre-crisis years, even if it’s way below the peak of the energy crisis.

HOST_A: Exactly. That “level versus rate” thing again. A 0.2% move sounds tiny, but the bill is still a major line item for households, and standing charges and unit rates still matter.

HOST_B: And in the U.S., there isn’t one national cap. It’s patchwork: regulated utilities, state commissions, and then you’ve got gasoline prices that people treat like a daily mood ring.

HOST_A: Gasoline is the one people see on giant signs. And here we can cite AAA directly. AAA’s national average for regular gasoline was $2.836 as of December 27, 2025. That’s a verified number from AAA’s tracker. And in plain English: under three bucks national average is psychological relief.

HOST_B: But then, you open your electricity bill and you don’t feel relieved.

HOST_A: Right. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration put out its winter heating outlook on October 15, 2025. The EIA expected households heated by electricity to pay more this winter than last winter, driven by higher retail electricity prices, while households heated by natural gas would pay about the same, and propane or heating oil households might pay less. That’s a forecast, not a fact, and it’s crucial we label it: EIA is projecting, not reporting a finished season.

HOST_B: But forecasts shape expectations, and expectations shape decisions. If you expect a higher electric bill, you might cut elsewhere now.

HOST_A: Exactly. And this is where the cost-of-living squeeze becomes this weird game of Whac-A-Mole. Gasoline gives you a break, then electric costs creep. Or inflation slows, but rent doesn’t. Or food inflation cools, but services stay stubborn.

HOST_B: Let’s do food for a second, because people notice food. And they notice it weekly, not monthly.

HOST_A: In the U.K., the ONS November 2025 inflation bulletin specifically said food and non-alcoholic beverages, along with alcohol and tobacco, made large downward contributions to the change in inflation rates, and it noted food and non-alcoholic drink prices fell on the month. That’s official ONS commentary. The headline: some easing pressure there, but again, at a high base.

HOST_B: In the U.S., we can tie wages to groceries with the real earnings data. BLS real earnings for November 2025, published December 18, 2025, said real average hourly earnings for all employees increased 0.8% from November 2024 to November 2025, and that result came from nominal hourly earnings up 3.5% combined with CPI-U up 2.7%.

HOST_A: That’s an important “working families” metric because it answers the question: did your paycheck, on average, keep up with prices? Over that year, yes, slightly, on average. But “on average” hides a lot.

HOST_B: Here’s the controversial-but-plausible thing I’m going to say, and then we’ll clean it up. Sometimes I think policymakers and commentators hide behind the average because it lets them claim victory. They say, “Real wages are up,” and then the family paying more for childcare and rent is told they’re basically imagining things.

HOST_A: That’s a fair critique in terms of communication. Where I’ll push back is: the average is not a lie, it’s incomplete. It’s a genuine statistic, but it’s not your household. If your rent rose faster than your wage, you feel it. If you had to change jobs and lost a predictable schedule, you feel it. If you’re paying interest on credit cards, the rate matters as much as the prices.

HOST_B: And the average also doesn’t capture that some categories rise faster than others. Even if headline inflation is 2.7% in the U.S., your personal basket might be more like five, six, or ten, depending on housing and healthcare and commuting.

HOST_A: Exactly. That’s not a conspiracy. That’s math. And I want to say this plainly: when people say “inflation is down,” what they usually mean is “the inflation rate has slowed.” If what you hear is “prices are going back,” you’ll feel lied to. That gap in language is a big part of why the cost-of-living conversation turns toxic.

HOST_B: Okay, but people also want someone to blame. And “math” is not satisfying. So let’s talk causes, but carefully. What’s verified, what’s debated?

HOST_A: Verified: In both countries, inflation has eased from peaks. Verified: housing and rents remain a major pressure. Verified: in the U.K., the energy price cap for early 2026 is set at £1,758. Verified: in the U.S., CPI-U was up 2.7% year over year in November 2025 and real average hourly earnings were up 0.8% year over year. Verified: U.S. gas prices are under $3 national average as of December 27, 2025, per AAA.

HOST_B: Now the debated part: why does it still feel so brutal?

HOST_A: Here are the main buckets, and I’ll label them as claims where appropriate. First claim: housing supply constraints, including underbuilding in some regions and slow permitting, keep prices and rents sticky. Second claim: services inflation tends to be persistent because it’s labor-intensive, and wages feed into service costs. Third claim: energy remains volatile globally even when your local price is stable, and that volatility gets priced into contracts and risk. Fourth claim: many households built up debt or depleted savings during earlier inflation spikes, so even if inflation slows, the damage is still in the budget.

HOST_B: I’ll add a fifth claim that always gets people mad: corporate pricing power. The idea that in some sectors, firms raised prices beyond what costs required because they could.

HOST_A: That’s debated, and it varies by sector. It’s plausible in some markets; it’s not a universal explanation. And we don’t have a single definitive statistic in our source set today to prove or disprove it across the economy, so we treat it as a claim and not a fact.

HOST_B: Here’s another one: tariffs. In the U.S., tariffs became a major topic this year, and it shows up in the consumer confidence reporting. Reuters said consumers mentioned inflation, tariffs, trade, and politics as concerns, and the Conference Board release also points to anxiety about jobs and income. That doesn’t prove tariffs caused inflation, but it does show they’re part of people’s mental model.

HOST_A: Right. And that matters because if people expect prices to rise, they behave differently. Some buy sooner. Some demand higher wages. Some cut back. Expectations can be self-fulfilling in pockets.

HOST_B: Let’s translate all this into the question people actually ask: “What can I realistically expect next?”

HOST_A: For the U.S., based on the verified November 2025 CPI at 2.7% and the real earnings up 0.8%, the realistic expectation is not “prices will fall.” It’s “the pace of price increases may be calmer than the worst period,” but household pain can continue because big-ticket items like rent don’t reset quickly. On housing specifically, the Zillow data suggests rent growth is muted nationally and concessions are elevated, which means some renters may have negotiating leverage right now, especially in markets with higher vacancy or more new supply.

HOST_B: So: the next six months could be less about sticker shock and more about stubborn bills.

HOST_A: Exactly. For the U.K., official inflation at 3.2% in November is still above the BoE target, but the BoE is already easing rates, down to 3.75% as of the decision published December 18, 2025. That’s a sign they think disinflation is on track, even if they’re divided. The Ofgem cap for January through March 2026 is basically flat, a 0.2% increase. And ONS rent inflation is still running at 4.4% year over year to November. So the realistic expectation in the U.K. is: energy is not exploding right now, inflation is easing, rates are coming down, but rent is still rising meaningfully, and that keeps the pressure on.

HOST_B: That’s the macro. Let’s go micro. You’re Gary, you’re commuting, you’re feeding kids, you’ve got pets. When you say “cope now,” what do you mean that doesn’t sound like a condescending lecture?

HOST_A: I mean you look for the biggest controllable line items and you fight for small wins that add up. Not “stop buying lattes.” I hate that. I mean: housing, utilities, transportation, and recurring subscriptions or insurance. That’s where real money is.

HOST_B: Okay, but don’t list it like a personal finance influencer. Talk it through like a human.

HOST_A: Fair. Housing first. If you’re renting in the U.S., the Zillow report showing nearly two in five listings with concessions is permission to ask. If your lease is up, you don’t just accept the first renewal number. You ask what incentives are on the table, you check comparable listings, you ask about a longer lease, you ask about timing. You do it politely, but you do it. And if you’re in a market where rents are softening, your landlord may prefer a slightly lower rent to a vacancy.

HOST_B: And if you’re in a market where everything is tight, like certain parts of New York, that advice can feel laughable.

HOST_A: True. In a tight market, your leverage is smaller, but it’s not always zero. Even in tight markets, landlords sometimes prefer stability: on-time payments, low hassle. You can ask for repairs, you can ask for a small adjustment, you can ask for a multi-year deal with a predictable increase. The worst they can say is no. And if they say no, you’ve lost five minutes and gained clarity.

HOST_B: U.K. renters don’t always get that kind of flexibility, but the principle is similar: don’t sleepwalk into a renewal. And if you’re a homeowner on a variable rate or refinancing, the BoE rate cut to 3.75% matters over time. Not instantly, but it’s part of the trend.

HOST_A: Next: energy. In the U.K., if you’re on a default tariff, the Ofgem cap tells you the ceiling of unit rates and standing charges for that period, but it doesn’t mean you’re getting the cheapest possible deal. People should at least check whether a fixed deal makes sense for their situation. Not because fixed is always better; sometimes it isn’t. But because “I haven’t looked in two years” is how people overpay.

HOST_B: And in the U.S., the energy conversation depends on where you live. But the EIA winter outlook is a reminder: if you heat with electricity, budget for a possible bump. If you heat with natural gas, the projection was closer to flat compared to last winter, but weather and local rates can change the story. Again, that’s a forecast; it’s not guaranteed.

HOST_A: Transportation. U.S. gas under $3 national average, per AAA as of December 27, 2025, is a gift. If you drive, that’s a moment to rebuild margin. Not to instantly absorb it into other spending. If you can, take part of the savings and put it toward a buffer, because gas can move fast.

HOST_B: This is where I say something slightly inflammatory: Americans treat cheap gas like a stimulus check and then act shocked when the credit card bill is high.

HOST_A: It’s not always that simple, but yes, people mentally spend the savings. And I get it. Life is expensive. If you’ve been saying “no” to your kids all year, the gas break feels like oxygen. But building even a small buffer changes the stress level.

HOST_B: Food. People can’t “cancel” food. They can only switch where they buy it, what they buy, and how much waste happens at home.

HOST_A: Exactly. And I’m not going to pretend you can coupon your way out of structural costs. But you can control waste. You can plan two or three default meals. You can use store brands strategically. And you can be honest about which convenience spending is actually buying time, which is sometimes worth it, versus which is just habit.

HOST_B: Services is the sneaky one. Haircuts, childcare, car repairs, insurance, everything billed monthly. This is where people feel the squeeze because you can’t always substitute. You can’t say, “I’ll buy a cheaper childcare.”

HOST_A: Right. And this is why “inflation is down” doesn’t land. Services tend to lag. Wages for service workers rise, which is good for them, but it can keep service prices elevated. That’s not bad; it’s just the mechanism. And again, verified data point: in the U.S., real wages were up slightly year over year, but that does not mean every household has breathing room.

HOST_B: Let’s address the policy piece, because this is a news show, and people want to know what governments and central banks are doing, and whether it helps or hurts.

HOST_A: In the U.K., the Bank of England is already cutting, down to 3.75% as of the meeting ending December 17, 2025. The minutes show it was a 5–4 vote, which tells you there’s internal disagreement about how fast to ease. That matters for households because rate cuts can eventually lower borrowing costs, but if the committee is split, the path down could be gradual and bumpy.

HOST_B: In the U.S., today we’re not anchoring on a specific Fed decision because our verified sources in front of us are the BLS price and wage releases, plus the consumer confidence indicators. But we can still say something true without overreaching: when inflation cools, central banks have more room to ease, and financial conditions can loosen, but households don’t automatically feel relief if the biggest line items are still high.

HOST_A: Exactly. And I’ll add: policy also includes things like benefits, tax thresholds, and social supports. Those aren’t in our core data sources today for the U.S., but for the U.K., Reuters reporting noted tax increases and how that affected real disposable income and saving behavior. That’s part of the squeeze too: it’s not just prices, it’s what you keep after taxes and what you have left after essentials.

HOST_B: Let’s do a reality check for working families listening right now. Say you’re a U.S. household. You hear: CPI 2.7% year over year in November 2025. Real hourly earnings up 0.8% year over year. Gas is $2.836 on average as of December 27, 2025. Rents, nationally, are $1,925 typical asking rent, basically flat-ish. What does that actually mean for your January?

HOST_A: It means January might not hit you with the kind of across-the-board sticker shock we saw in earlier years, but your budget is still tight because you’re starting from a high cost base. The “win” is that your paycheck is not falling behind headline inflation on average, and gas is relatively cheap right now. The “risk” is that rent, healthcare, insurance, and debt interest can still eat the gains. The “move” is to treat any pocket of relief like gas prices as a chance to stabilize, even if it’s small.

HOST_B: Now U.K. household. CPI 3.2% in November 2025. Rent inflation 4.4% year over year to November, average rent £1,366. Bank Rate 3.75% as of the decision published December 18, 2025. Energy price cap set at £1,758 for January to March 2026. What does that mean?

HOST_A: It means inflation is easing but still above target. Energy is not spiking right now, but it remains a big bill. Rent remains a standout pressure. Interest rates are coming down, which can help mortgages and some borrowing, but it can take time to flow through. So households should expect continued pressure, with a possible gradual improvement if rates continue down and inflation continues easing, but no instant reset.

HOST_B: Okay. I want to tackle a question that comes up a lot: “Are prices rising because wages are rising?” It’s a classic blame game. People point at worker pay like it’s the villain.

HOST_A: That’s where I’m going to be very clear. In the U.S., BLS real earnings data shows real hourly earnings rose 0.8% year over year in November 2025, with nominal hourly earnings up 3.5% and CPI up 2.7%. Those are verified numbers. That suggests wages are rising, yes, but not in some runaway way that screams “wage-price spiral” in that one-year snapshot. In the U.K., the BoE minutes talk about pay growth and services inflation easing, but still watching persistence. So policymakers are monitoring wages, but it’s not a moral story. It’s an economic one.

HOST_B: And morally, it’s hard to tell people who are struggling that their wages are the problem when those wages are what keeps the lights on.

HOST_A: Exactly. A working family wants stable prices and stable wages and a predictable life. That’s not radical. That’s normal.

HOST_B: Let’s do another thing people argue about: “Is it corporate greed?” That’s the internet’s favorite one-word explanation.

HOST_A: The honest answer is: sometimes firms expand margins, sometimes they don’t, and it depends on competition, supply constraints, and demand. But the deeper story is that “cost of living” isn’t one market. It’s a pile of markets. Housing has its own constraints. Energy has global and local drivers. Food depends on commodities, labor, logistics, and retail structure. Services depend on wages and capacity. If you compress it into one villain, you miss the solutions.

HOST_B: But the reason people want one villain is because the alternative is overwhelming. “It’s complicated” feels like “nobody’s in charge.”

HOST_A: That’s why the “standards” matter. We can say: the data show inflation has eased. We can say: prices remain high. We can say: rent is still a major squeeze in both the U.S. and the U.K. We can say: energy bills are constrained in the U.K. by the cap, and in the U.S. gas is relatively cheap right now, but electricity costs can still rise. That’s not “nobody’s in charge.” That’s a map of the problem.

HOST_B: Let’s make it more concrete with lived experience. You, Gary, what’s the cost-of-living story in your life right now?

HOST_A: I’ll keep it simple. The pain is not one thing; it’s the pile-up. Rent is the base layer. Then groceries. Then school stuff for kids. Then transit, and sometimes driving to Jersey City changes the math depending on gas and tolls. You can handle one increase. You can’t handle five categories creeping at once. And what really breaks people isn’t just the amount. It’s the unpredictability. The “Oh, that’s more now too?” feeling.

HOST_B: That unpredictability is what kills planning.

HOST_A: Exactly. So coping is partly math and partly psychology. You want fewer surprises. You want automatic payments you can trust. You want a buffer. And you want to renegotiate the things that are negotiable, because you don’t get points for being polite while overpaying.

HOST_B: That’s a line. “You don’t get points for being polite while overpaying.”

HOST_A: I mean it. There’s a difference between being respectful and being passive.

HOST_B: Before we close, I want to zoom out globally for a beat, because the topic is global cost of living, and we’ve been U.S.-U.K. heavy.

HOST_A: Fair. Globally, the common threads are: energy volatility, housing constraints in many cities, and supply chain shocks that didn’t fully unwind evenly. But since today’s source set is U.S.-U.K.-anchored, I’m not going to toss out global numbers we haven’t verified in these documents. The responsible way to do global is to either bring in official global sources, or clearly label it as general context.

HOST_B: So here’s the general context, labeled as a claim: many households across advanced economies experienced a sharp rise in prices earlier in the decade, and even as inflation rates cool, price levels remain elevated, which keeps political and social pressure high.

HOST_A: That’s fair as a general claim. Now, where I want to end is this: what can working families realistically expect next, and how do they cope now, without false hope.

HOST_B: Give it to me in your grounded, non-ideological way.

HOST_A: Realistically, don’t expect a magical “prices go back” moment. Expect a slow normalization where some categories cool and others stay stubborn. In the U.S., the verified trend is that headline inflation is not running away right now, and real wages were up slightly year over year as of November 2025, but housing remains the big constraint. In the U.K., inflation eased to 3.2% in November 2025, rates have started coming down to 3.75%, and the energy cap is basically flat into early 2026, but rent is still rising at 4.4% year over year to November. That’s the realistic landscape.

HOST_B: And coping now?

HOST_A: Coping now is: protect housing stability, shop your energy plan where you can, treat any savings like cheaper gas as a chance to rebuild cushion, and reduce recurring waste. And if you’re in a position to negotiate—rent, insurance, phone plans—do it. Not aggressively. Just consistently.

HOST_B: I’m going to add one more: if you’re feeling ashamed about struggling, don’t. The cost-of-living squeeze is not a personal failure. It’s a structural problem landing on individual households.

HOST_A: That’s important. And also: ask for help early if you need it. Whether that’s talking to your utility provider, your landlord, or a local assistance program. People wait until it’s a crisis. The system is not kind in a crisis.

HOST_B: Okay. Quick wrap. What’s the headline you’d write for this conversation?

HOST_A: “Inflation is easing, but the bills are still high—and rent is still the boss fight.”

HOST_B: That’s accurate and depressing.

HOST_A: It’s accurate and actionable. And for anybody listening: our promise is we’ll keep separating the facts from the noise, and we’ll keep this focused on working families and long-term stability, not hot takes.

HOST_B: From me: skeptical but not cynical. We’ll keep asking the annoying questions so you don’t have to.

HOST_A: That’s Margaret Butcher. I’m Gary Thompson. Thanks for listening.
