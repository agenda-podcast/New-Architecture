OpenAI has safety teams, Anthropic built their whole company around AI safety, Google and Microsoft have AI ethics boards. So for them, this is largely formalizing existing practices."

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "I think it's both things. The big companies genuinely care about safety—they don't want to be responsible for an AI disaster. But they're also businesses, and they're not unhappy about regulatory moats."

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "This is where the framework has teeth. They borrowed the enforcement model from GDPR, which has proven effective. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue. For major tech companies, that's potentially billions of dollars."

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "Exactly, and that's intentional. The fines are scaled—minor violations might get warnings or smaller fines. But serious or repeated violations can trigger those maximum penalties. There's even provision for the Tech Policy Institute to require a company to stop operating an AI system until compliance issues are fixed."
        },

        },
        {
          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "There are several direct impacts. Most obviously, you'll see more transparency and disclosure. When you use an AI system, you'll have clearer information about what it can and can't do, when you're talking to AI versus a human, and what the limitations are. This should help set more realistic expectations."
        },

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "Exactly. You'll also see clearer labeling of AI-generated content. If an article, image, or video was created by AI, that needs to be disclosed. This is important for media literacy and combating misinformation."

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "We might see slightly slower deployment of new AI features as companies take time for safety reviews and compliance. We might see some consolidation if smaller players struggle with compliance costs. But we might also see more confidence in deploying AI in new areas once there are clear rules everyone's following."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "B",

        {
          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "Right. Regulatory clarity can actually be good for business because it removes uncertainty. Companies know what's expected and can plan accordingly."

          "speaker": "B",

        },
        {
          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "Probably not dramatically. Compliance costs are real but relatively small compared to the big cost drivers like compute infrastructure and engineering talent. We might see a few percentage points added to costs, but we're not talking about doubling prices or anything like that."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "B",

        },
        {
          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "This is really important. The US framework exists within a broader context of international AI regulation. The EU has its AI Act, the UK has principles, China has its own regulations. And there's been coordination between these regulatory bodies to try to align approaches where possible."

        {
          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "Exactly. And the US framework actually has language about mutual recognition—if you can demonstrate compliance with equivalent standards in another jurisdiction, that might be accepted here. So there's an attempt to reduce duplicative compliance work."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "B",

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "First major milestone is detailed technical guidelines expected in early 2026. Right now, we have the high-level framework, but companies need specifics about exactly what documentation looks like, what audit processes involve, what's acceptable. Those details matter a lot."

        {
          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "I think it's a necessary step. AI has reached the point where some governance is needed—the technology is too powerful and too widely deployed to just wing it. But the framework seems reasonably balanced. It's focused on achievable goals like transparency and safety rather than trying to micromanage technical choices. It has teeth through real enforcement mechanisms. And it's happening as part of a broader international movement, which helps with consistency."

          "speaker": "A",
          "text": "Main concern is the impact on small players and whether this inadvertently consolidates power with big tech companies. But that's a tension inherent in any safety regulation—you want high standards, but high standards have costs. I think we'll need to watch the implementation closely and be ready to adjust if it's creating unnecessary barriers."
