Margaret Butcher: The policy angle matters. In the UK, inflation has cooled from peak levels but remains a central risk to consumer confidence and borrowing costs, with the Bank of England watching wage growth and services inflation closely. In the US, inflation has moderated, but shelter and energy costs still influence price levels and real wages. The question for families is practical: what supportive measures are likely to materialize, and how should households adapt now?
Gary Thompson: Our focus is on how to cope while these dynamics unfold—budgeting, energy efficiency, and smart choices on housing and essentials.
