SCRIPT:
HOST_A: Good morning and welcome to the program. It is Friday, October 25, 2024. I am Gary Thompson, coming to you from our Jersey City studio. We are looking at a very busy news cycle in the world of entertainment and business today, specifically focusing on a figure who seems to be everywhere at once right now. Selena Gomez. Now, I will be the first to admit that I am not usually the one tracking pop star movements, but when you look at the sheer scale of what she is doing this week, from a major television premiere in Los Angeles last night to the mounting Oscar buzz for her latest film, it is hard to ignore the sheer work ethic on display. Joining me to break this down is Margaret Butcher. Margaret, you have been looking at the reports coming out of the El Capitan Theatre from just a few hours ago.

HOST_B: I have, Gary. And it is quite a scene. Last night, October 24, was the official premiere of Wizards Beyond Waverly Place. This is the sequel series to the show that originally put her on the map back in 2007. She was there on the red carpet with her former co-star David Henrie. It is an interesting move, Gary. Usually, when someone reaches the level of success she has, they try to distance themselves from their Disney Channel roots. They want to be seen as serious actors or high-fashion icons. But here she is, executive producing and guest-starring in a show for the next generation of kids. I have to ask, is this a genuine moment of giving back, or is this just a very savvy way to maintain a grip on a younger demographic that fuels her Rare Beauty empire?

HOST_A: Well, Margaret, I tend to look at it through the lens of stability and legacy. In any other industry, if a CEO went back to the shop floor to mentor the new hires, we would call that good leadership. She is forty-three years old in spirit sometimes with the way she talks about her responsibilities. She told reporters on the carpet last night that she felt it was important to ensure the new cast had a safe and supportive environment, something she has hinted was not always the case during the mid-2000s era of child stardom. To me, that sounds like someone who values the institution that gave her a start and wants to fix the cracks in the foundation.

HOST_B: That is a very charitable view, Gary. And I do not disagree that she seems sincere. She was wearing a custom red Rodarte dress, looking every bit the movie star, yet she was spending her time talking about the young actress Janice LeAnn Brown, who is taking over the lead role. But let us look at the timing. This premiere on October 24 happens right as her film Emilia Pérez is hitting a critical mass in the awards conversation. There is a claim being made by several critics, and reported by the BBC and Variety yesterday, that she is a frontrunner for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Is it possible that the Wizards premiere is part of a larger campaign to show her range? From a Disney mentor to a gritty, Spanish-language musical about a cartel leader?

HOST_A: It is a massive range, certainly. But let us stick to the facts of the Wizards premiere first. The reports from Deadline and The Hollywood Reporter confirm that the show premieres on Disney Channel on October 29 and will be on Disney+ the following day. Gomez is an executive producer here. That is a position of accountability. She is not just showing up for a cameo; she is responsible for the budget, the casting, and the direction. In my house, we talk about finishing what you start. She started with Wizards, and now she is ensuring it continues properly. Margaret, you mentioned the billionaire status earlier. That has been a huge part of the conversation in the last twenty-four hours as well.

HOST_B: It has. And this is where I play the skeptic, Gary. Forbes and Bloomberg have both been updating their profiles on her wealth this week. She recently spoke to reporters about this, and her quote was quite interesting. She said she finds it distasteful to talk about money. She claimed that she does not focus on the numbers and that she credits the people who buy the products at Rare Beauty for that success. Now, Gary, you are a man who values the rule of law and financial transparency. Does it sit well with you when a billionaire says talking about money is distasteful? It feels a bit like a deflection from the reality of her massive influence.

HOST_A: I think there is a middle ground there, Margaret. I live in South Brooklyn. I see people working two jobs just to pay rent. If a celebrity starts flaunting their bank account, it creates a disconnect. I actually find her approach somewhat pragmatic. If she is focused on the product and the philanthropy, which is a verified fact—the Rare Impact Fund has a goal of raising one hundred million dollars for mental health services—then the wealth is a byproduct of a functioning business. She is not a hedge fund manager; she is selling a product people clearly want. The reports from yesterday indicate that Rare Beauty is still the primary driver of her net worth, far more than her music or acting contracts.

HOST_B: That is true. Rare Beauty is valued at over two billion dollars. But let us look at the acting side again, because that is where the "fresh news" is really heating up. Yesterday, October 24, Netflix released more promotional material for Emilia Pérez. This is a film where she plays the wife of a cartel boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery. It is a bold choice. Some might even say it is a risky choice for someone with such a massive, young fan base. Gary, you often talk about public safety and the rule of law. This film deals with some very heavy, dark themes. Do you think her fans are ready to follow her from the Waverly Place substation to the world of Mexican cartels?

HOST_B: I think the audience grows up with the performer, Margaret. That is the natural progression of things. If she stayed in the "Wizards" lane forever, she would lose her relevance. What I find interesting is the report from Rolling Stone yesterday where she discussed her career shift. She mentioned that she is becoming more selective. She is not just taking every role offered. She is looking for projects that challenge the status quo. Now, I am not one for extremism in any form, but I do appreciate an artist who wants to push their own boundaries. The fact is, she is managing a multi-billion dollar company while also being a top-tier contender for an Oscar. That requires a level of discipline that I think we should respect.

HOST_B: Discipline, yes. But let us talk about the personal narrative she is projecting. In the last twenty-four hours, there has been a lot of social media chatter about her relationship with Benny Blanco. They have been very public lately. Some critics claim this is a "PR relationship" to keep her in the headlines during awards season. Others say it is the most stable she has ever looked. Gary, you are a family man. You have three kids. You value long-term stability. When you see a public figure like Gomez being so open about her personal life, does it feel like she is building a stable foundation, or is it just more content for the machine?

HOST_A: It is a fine line, Margaret. But look at the history. She has been in the public eye since she was seven or eight years old. She has dealt with lupus, a kidney transplant, and very public breakups. If she is finding stability now, at thirty-two, I think that is a positive for her brand and her health. The facts are that she has been very transparent about her health struggles. Yesterday, there were follow-up reports on her comments regarding her inability to carry her own children due to medical issues. She has turned what could be a private tragedy into a public conversation about the different ways people can become parents. That is not "content" in the cynical sense; that is using a platform to normalize a very common struggle for many families.

HOST_B: I will give you that, Gary. It is a powerful message. But I want to go back to the Wizards premiere for a moment. There was a specific moment on the carpet where she was asked about the future of the franchise. She said she wants this to be something that lasts for years, not just a one-off. This brings up the question of over-saturation. We have Only Murders in the Building, which just wrapped its fourth season and has been renewed for a fifth. We have the new Wizards show. We have the movie Emilia Pérez. We have the beauty brand. We have the music she keeps hinting at. Is there a point where the Selena Gomez brand becomes too big to fail, or worse, too big to be interesting?

HOST_A: That is the risk of any major institution, Margaret. But as long as there is accountability, it works. She is the common thread. If the quality of the work stays high—and the reviews for Only Murders and Emilia Pérez suggest it is—then the market will sustain it. I look at it like a local business that expands. If they keep the quality of the coffee the same, I do not care if they have one shop or ten. The problem arises when the person at the top loses sight of the work. From everything we saw yesterday at the premiere, she seems more engaged with the "work" of being a producer and a mentor than ever before.

HOST_B: It is also worth noting the regional focus here. In the UK, Emilia Pérez has been getting a lot of traction in the broadsheets. The Guardian and the BBC have both run pieces in the last twenty-four hours discussing how she is breaking the "pop star turned actor" curse. In the US, the focus is much more on the Disney nostalgia and her business success. It is a two-pronged attack on the global market. She is winning over the high-brow critics in Europe and the suburban families in the US. It is a very calculated, very effective strategy.

HOST_A: Calculated does not have to be a dirty word, Margaret. It can mean well-planned. It can mean responsible. We want our public figures to be responsible. We want them to have a plan. I would much rather see this level of professional execution than the chaotic, self-destructive behavior we see from other stars. She is providing jobs for hundreds of people on these sets and in her company. That is a contribution to the economy that we should not overlook.

HOST_B: I suppose I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop. It feels almost too perfect right now. The billionaire status, the Oscar buzz, the successful TV return, the happy relationship. In the world of celebrity news, we are conditioned to look for the crack in the armor. But you are right, Gary. If we look at the verified facts from the last twenty-four hours, there is no scandal. There is just a lot of work being premiered and a lot of positive reception.

HOST_A: And that is where we should leave it. The facts are these: Selena Gomez executive produced and attended the premiere of Wizards Beyond Waverly Place on October 24, 2024. She is currently receiving critical acclaim for her role in Emilia Pérez. Her company, Rare Beauty, continues to be a leader in the industry both financially and philanthropically. She is navigating a complex career with a level of pragmatism that is rare in Hollywood. Whether you are a fan of the music or not, the business and professional model she is building is something to watch. Margaret, thank you for the perspective.

HOST_B: Always a pleasure, Gary. I will keep my notes ready for the next update.

HOST_A: And thank you all for listening. We will be back with more news on the hour. This is Gary Thompson, signing off.
