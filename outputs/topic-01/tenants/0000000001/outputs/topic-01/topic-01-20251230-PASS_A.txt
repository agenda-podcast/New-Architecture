SCRIPT:
HOST_A: Good morning from the studio. It is Thursday, October 24, 2024. I am Gary Thompson. I am coming to you after a fairly standard commute from South Brooklyn. The cats were acting up this morning, and the guinea pigs were whistling for their carrots before the sun was even up, but we made it. My kids are off to school, and I am here in Jersey City ready to look at the news through a lens of what actually matters for the long term. Today, we are talking about a figure who has been in the public eye for two decades but seems to be hitting a new gear of professional maturity. We are talking about Selena Gomez. Margaret, you have been tracking the dispatches coming out of Georgia over the last twenty-four hours. What is the latest?

HOST_B: Thanks, Gary. It has been a very busy window for Selena Gomez. Just yesterday, October 23, she was down in Georgia for the SCAD Savannah Film Festival. This is a big stop on the awards circuit, and she was there to receive the Virtuoso Award. This is specifically for her performance in the new film Emilia Pérez. It is a Jacques Audiard film, a Spanish-language musical about a cartel leader who seeks gender-affirming surgery. Selena plays Jessi, the wife of the cartel leader. The buzz coming out of Savannah is intense. People are calling this the definitive pivot in her career. She was seen on the red carpet in a very understated, elegant black gown, greeting fans, but the real meat of the story is the interview she gave regarding her craft and her future.

HOST_A: You know, Margaret, I look at someone like Selena Gomez and I think about the institutions of celebrity. We have seen so many people who start as child stars and then the wheels come off because there is no accountability or no long-term plan. But what I am seeing here, especially with this Virtuoso Award on October 23, is a person who is treating her career like a serious trade. She is forty-three years old—wait, no, I am forty-three, she is thirty-two—but she has the poise of someone who has been working a steady job for thirty years. She is showing up, doing the work, and now she is being recognized by the film community, not just the pop music world.

HOST_B: It is interesting you mention the work, Gary, because I want to push back a little on the idea that this is just a "steady job." This film, Emilia Pérez, is a massive risk. It is a musical about the Mexican cartel. She is singing in Spanish. In her interviews yesterday with The Hollywood Reporter and Variety, she admitted that she was terrified of the role. She said she felt she had to prove she belonged in that space. Now, as a skeptic, I have to ask: is this Virtuoso Award just part of a very well-oiled Oscar campaign machine? Netflix is pushing this film hard. They have a release date of November 13 coming up. Is she actually a virtuoso, or is she just the most famous person in a very artistic film?

HOST_A: That is a fair question, Margaret. We have to distinguish between the marketing and the merit. But look at the facts of the performance. She is working with Jacques Audiard, a director who does not suffer fools. He is a Palme d'Or winner. If she did not have the chops, she would not be in the frame. What I appreciate, from a pragmatic standpoint, is that she is not resting on her laurels. She has the most followed Instagram account for a woman, she has a billion-dollar beauty brand in Rare Beauty, and she could easily just sit back and collect checks. Instead, she is in Savannah, Georgia, on a Wednesday night, talking about the technical challenges of singing in her native language, which she has admitted she had to work hard to reclaim. That shows a level of professional accountability that I respect.

HOST_B: She did speak about that specifically yesterday. She mentioned to Entertainment Weekly that singing in Spanish for this role was a different kind of vulnerability. It wasn't just about hitting the notes; it was about the character's pain. And she linked that to her own life. She has been very open lately about her health struggles and the fact that she cannot carry her own children. Some might say she is oversharing, Gary. Is there a point where the personal brand and the professional work become too blurred? Does knowing about her medical history make her a better actress, or is it just part of the modern celebrity industrial complex?

HOST_B: I will say, though, that her fans in Savannah yesterday did not seem to care about the "industrial complex" part. There are reports from the Daily Mail and local outlets that she spent a significant amount of time with the students at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She wasn't just there for the trophy; she was doing a masterclass. She told them that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. I find that plausible, but also a bit of a convenient narrative for someone who is currently the face of a "mental health focused" beauty brand.

HOST_A: See, Margaret, this is where we might disagree on the "convenience" of it. I look at it as a father. I have three kids. I want them to see people in positions of power who are honest about their limitations. If she is using her platform to say, "Hey, I have these health issues, I have these struggles, but I am still showing up to work and winning awards," that provides a stable roadmap for young people. It is not extremist; it is just human. And the fact that she is doing this while her show, Only Murders in the Building, is wrapping up another successful season shows she is managing multiple high-level responsibilities. That is a lot of balls to keep in the air without dropping them.

HOST_B: Let's talk about the Oscar buzz specifically, because that was a major theme in the Rolling Stone and Variety pieces from the last twenty-four hours. The critics are placing her firmly in the Supporting Actress race. If she gets the nomination, she becomes one of the few Disney alumni to really cross over into that top-tier Academy circle. But Gary, the film is a musical. Some critics at the BBC have noted that the genre-bending nature of Emilia Pérez might be too "out there" for the traditional Academy voters. Do you think her public image, which is very grounded and "plainspoken" as you like to say, helps bridge that gap for a movie that is essentially a French-directed Mexican cartel musical?

HOST_A: I think it does. People trust her. They feel they know her. In a world where everything feels like an act, her brand of "lived experience" feels authentic to people. Whether it is 100% authentic or 80% authentic doesn't matter as much as the fact that it functions as a stabilizing force in her career. She isn't chasing trends. She isn't trying to be a "diva." She is in Savannah talking to film students. That is a very "working class" approach to being a global superstar. She is putting in the hours.

HOST_B: I will concede that the Rare Impact Fund, which she also discussed yesterday, is a concrete institution. It is not just a hashtag. They are actually putting money into mental health services in schools. That aligns with your value of institutions, Gary. She is building something that outlasts a movie's theatrical run. However, I do wonder if the pressure of being this "perfectly vulnerable" role model is sustainable. She mentioned in The Hollywood Reporter yesterday that she sometimes feels the weight of everyone's expectations. She said, and I am paraphrasing, that she has to be careful not to lose herself in the "Selena Gomez" of it all.

HOST_A: That is the risk of the job. But look at the alternative. We see so many people in her position who flame out because they have no foundation. She has her family, she has her business, and she has a clear sense of her own limitations. To me, that is the definition of a virtuoso—not just someone who is good at their craft, but someone who understands the instrument they are playing, which in this case is her own life and career.

HOST_B: It is a compelling argument. And the timing is perfect. With the Savannah Film Festival giving her this platform right now, she is effectively kicking off the final sprint for the year. We have the Netflix release in three weeks. We have the soundtrack for Emilia Pérez which is already getting traction on Billboard. She is effectively dominating the film, music, and business news cycles simultaneously this morning.

HOST_A: And she is doing it without a scandal. In this day and age, that is a feat in itself. No extremism, no public meltdowns, just a professional at the top of her game receiving an award in Georgia. It is a reminder that long-term stability comes from consistent work and a bit of humility. Margaret, I think we have defined the standard here. She is setting a bar for how to transition from a teen idol to a serious institutional player in Hollywood.

HOST_B: I agree with that. Even a skeptic like me has to admit that the sheer volume of her output, and the quality of the collaborators she is choosing, suggests this isn't a fluke. It is a calculated, well-executed career phase. Whether the Oscar comes or not, the Virtuoso Award she picked up yesterday marks a turning point.

HOST_A: Well said. To summarize for our listeners: Selena Gomez was in Savannah, Georgia, on October 23, 2024, to receive the Virtuoso Award for her role in Emilia Pérez. She is navigating a heavy awards season while maintaining her business interests and being open about her personal health challenges. It is a masterclass in professional management. We will be watching how the public responds when the film hits Netflix on November 13. That is our deep dive for this morning. I am Gary Thompson.

HOST_B: And I am Margaret Butcher. We will see you tomorrow.
