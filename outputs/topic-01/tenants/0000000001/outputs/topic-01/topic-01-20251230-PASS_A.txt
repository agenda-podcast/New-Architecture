SCRIPT:
HOST_A: Good morning from the studio. It is October 20, 2024. I am Gary Thompson. I am sitting here in Jersey City after a somewhat chaotic commute from South Brooklyn. My two cats decided to have a wrestling match at 4:00 AM, and the guinea pigs were not much quieter. But we are here, we are grounded, and we are looking at the news through a lens of what actually matters to working families and the stability of our culture. Today, we are talking about a figure who has been in the headlines for over a decade but seems to be hitting a new, more serious stride in the last twenty-four hours. I am talking about Selena Gomez. Margaret, you have been looking at the latest reports coming out of the Academy Museum Gala last night and some of these deep-dive interviews. What is the temperature right now?

HOST_B: It is high, Gary. Very high. I have my notes here, and it is interesting because we are seeing a convergence of three different Selenas. We have the business mogul who was recently tagged with the billionaire label by Bloomberg, the actor who is currently receiving genuine Oscar buzz for a very risky film called Emilia Pérez, and the public figure who is being incredibly candid about her personal health and her future. Last night at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles, she was one of the central figures. But I want to start with something you usually care about: the money and the accountability. She recently spoke to Bloomberg and then followed up in the last day about this billionaire status. She said it makes her uncomfortable. She said she finds it distasteful to talk about money. Gary, as someone who values the working-class perspective, does that ring true to you, or is that just good PR?

HOST_A: It is a complicated one, Margaret. When you are a naturalized citizen like I am, you see the American dream as something to be achieved through hard work and providing a service. Rare Beauty, her company, is valued at over two billion dollars. Most of her wealth comes from that, not her singing or acting. When she says it is distasteful to talk about, I think there is a pragmatic side to that. She knows that in a time when people in my neighborhood in Brooklyn are struggling with rent and the cost of groceries, flaunting a ten-figure net worth is a quick way to lose your audience. But I look at the accountability. She has the Rare Impact Fund. She is trying to raise a hundred million dollars for mental health. To me, the "distaste" for the title is less important than what the money is doing. If she is using that platform to stabilize mental health services, which are a public safety issue and a family stability issue, then I am inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. But you are the skeptic. Do you think she is just trying to stay relatable?

HOST_B: I think it is a bit of both. I am looking at a report from Variety published yesterday where she discusses her role in Emilia Pérez. This is a film about a Mexican cartel leader who seeks gender-affirming surgery and a new life. It is a musical. It is bold. It is the kind of project a "safe" pop star avoids. If she were just worried about her brand as a relatable billionaire, she would stay in the Only Murders in the Building lane, which is very safe, very cozy. But she is pushing into these spaces that are controversial. She told Variety that she is not even sure if she wants to continue with music full-time because she wants to be taken seriously as an actor. My question for you, Gary, is about that transition. We see celebrities try to "pivot" all the time to stay relevant. Is this a genuine career evolution, or is she just bored with the pop star life?

HOST_A: I think we have to look at the work ethic. She has been working since she was a child on Barney and then Disney. For a person in their early thirties to have that kind of longevity, there has to be a level of discipline. In the last twenty-four hours, the reviews for Emilia Pérez coming out of the UK screenings have been calling her performance "revelatory." The Guardian gave it a strong review, specifically mentioning her ability to disappear into a role that isn't "Selena Gomez." To me, that speaks to a respect for the craft. It is like any trade. If you are a plumber for twenty years and then you decide to become a contractor, you are building on your experience. She is not just jumping into this; she has been doing the work. And she is doing it while managing lupus and a kidney transplant. That brings me to the Hollywood Reporter piece from Friday that is still circulating today. She was very open about the fact that she cannot carry her own children.

HOST_B: That was a very heavy moment in the interview. She mentioned that due to her medical issues, she would have to use a surrogate or adopt. She said she had to "grieve" that reality. Now, Gary, I’m going to play the skeptic here. We live in an era of oversharing. Does a global superstar need to tell us about her reproductive health? Does it help the public discourse, or is it just more fuel for the celebrity gossip engine?

HOST_A: I look at it through the lens of my own family. I have three kids. My wife and I know how central that is to our lives. When someone with a platform like hers speaks about the reality of medical limitations, it de-stigmatizes it for regular families who are going through the same thing. There are thousands of people in the UK and the US right now dealing with the same heartbreak. When she says, "It’s not necessarily the way I envisioned it," she is being honest about the fact that life doesn't follow a script. That is a very grounded, very pragmatic thing to say. It rejects the "extremism" of the perfect celebrity life. It says, "I have a billion dollars, but I still have to deal with the rule of biology." I think that kind of honesty actually builds a more stable relationship with her audience. It’s not just "look at my shiny life." It’s "here is the reality of my body."

HOST_B: It is interesting you mention the "perfect life" because her relationship with Benny Blanco is also all over the news today. People Magazine just updated their timeline of their relationship this morning. They were seen together recently, and the public reaction is... mixed. Some people are very critical of him, his appearance, his personality. Selena has been very defensive of him. She basically told her fans to back off. Is that a wise move for someone who relies on public sentiment for her business? Or is she finally setting boundaries that we should respect?

HOST_A: Boundaries are essential for long-term stability, Margaret. If you let the "mob" or the "fandom" dictate who you sit at the dinner table with, you have no personal life. You have no foundation. As a father, I tell my kids that you have to stand up for the people you care about, even if it’s not popular. If she is happy and this relationship provides her with the support she needs while she deals with her health and her career, then the public’s opinion on his "vibe" is irrelevant. It’s about accountability to oneself. She is saying, "I am an adult, I am thirty-two years old, and I make my own choices." I respect that. It’s a rejection of the idea that celebrities are public property.

HOST_B: Let’s talk about Only Murders in the Building for a second. Deadline reported a few days ago that it’s been renewed for Season 5, and they are currently finishing up the rollout of Season 4. This show is a massive hit. It’s a "cozy mystery." It appeals to exactly the demographic you talk about—families, people who want something stable and entertaining. How does she balance being the "cozy" Mabel Mora on Hulu with being this "edgy" actor in a trans-themed cartel musical? Isn't there a risk of alienating the very people who made her a billionaire?

HOST_A: I don't think so. I think the public is smarter than we give them credit for. We can enjoy a cozy mystery on a Tuesday night and then go to the cinema to see a challenging piece of art on a Friday. What I see is a woman who is diversifying her "portfolio," so to speak. She has the Rare Beauty business which is her financial bedrock. She has the TV show which is her steady "job." And she has the films which are her "passion projects." That is a very pragmatic way to run a career. It’s like having a 401k, a steady paycheck, and a side business. It’s a model of stability. She isn't betting everything on one thing.

HOST_B: But what about the music? She told Variety in that interview yesterday that she might have "one more album" in her. For her fans, the "Selenators," that is a huge blow. She’s a pop star first for many of them. If she walks away from music, is she walking away from the thing that gave her a voice? Or is she just being honest about where her heart is?

HOST_A: She said in the interview that she never intended to be a full-time singer. She started in acting and the music just kind of happened. I think there is something to be said for knowing when to close a chapter. In our society, we are often told to "grind" and do everything until we burn out. If she recognizes that she doesn't have the same passion for touring—especially with her health concerns—then stopping is the responsible thing to do. It’s about long-term sustainability. If she tours and gets sick, everything else falls apart. Her business, her acting, her health. Choosing to focus on what she can manage is a sign of maturity.

HOST_B: I want to push back on the "billionaire" thing one more time. You mentioned the Rare Impact Fund. Bloomberg’s report notes that Rare Beauty donates 1% of all sales to mental health. 1% sounds small when you are talking about billions. Is that enough? Or is this just "philanthropy-washing" to make us feel better about buying a twenty-five-dollar blush?

HOST_A: 1% of a massive company is still millions of dollars. In the last year alone, they have funded dozens of organizations. Is it enough to fix the mental health crisis? No. But is it more than most other beauty brands are doing? Yes. We have to look at the "rule of law" and the standards we set. If we demand that every successful person solve every problem, we end up with nothing. I look at the fact that she is using her board meetings to talk about surgeon general warnings on social media for kids. She is using her influence to push for policy changes. That is a form of accountability that goes beyond just writing a check. She is using the "institutions" of her business to advocate for public safety.

HOST_B: It’s a fair point. I’m looking at the photos from the Academy Museum Gala again. She was wearing this custom black gown with white suede lapels. She looked... like a classic Hollywood star. Not a Disney kid. Not a pop star. A peer to the Meryl Streeps and the Nicole Kidmans who were also there. There is a sense in the last twenty-four hours that the industry is finally seeing her that way. But there is also the "Benny Blanco factor." He wasn't on the carpet with her, but he was mentioned in almost every interview. Do you think the media is obsessed with her personal life because they can't quite wrap their heads around her business success?

HOST_A: Absolutely. It is easier to talk about who she is dating than to analyze the supply chain and marketing strategy of a billion-dollar cosmetics company. It is easier to talk about her "feuds" with other celebrities—which she has repeatedly denied—than to talk about her performance in a Spanish-language musical. We tend to trivialize successful women by focusing on their relationships. But if you look at the facts of the last twenty-four hours, the facts are: she is a lead in a major Oscar-contending film, she is the head of a massive company, and she is using her platform to talk about serious health issues. Those are the "hard" news items. The rest is just noise.

HOST_B: Let’s talk about the UK perspective. Emilia Pérez is getting a lot of traction in the British press today. The BBC had a feature on it this morning. They are calling it a "bold gamble" for Netflix. In the UK, there is often a bit more skepticism toward the "American celebrity mogul" type. But the reviews there have been surprisingly warm toward her. They are highlighting her "vulnerability." Gary, why does that word "vulnerability" keep coming up with her? Is it a curated image, or is it something she can't help?

HOST_A: I think it’s her "lived experience," Margaret. When you have been through a kidney transplant, when you have been open about a bipolar diagnosis, when you have dealt with the physical changes that come with lupus medication—and you’ve done it all in front of a camera—you don't have the luxury of a "perfect" image. She has been forced to be vulnerable. And in a world that feels very fake, especially on social media, that vulnerability feels like a "plainspoken" truth. It’s why people in my neighborhood, people who don't care about pop music, might still respect her. She’s not pretending that life is easy. She’s saying, "I have all this success, and I still have to fight for my health every day." That is a very grounded message.

HOST_B: It’s interesting you mention the "plainspoken" aspect. In her Variety interview, she talked about how she doesn't feel like she "belongs" in the high-fashion, high-wealth world sometimes. She said she still feels like the girl from Texas. Now, I’ve heard every celebrity say that. "I’m just a small-town girl." But then they fly on private jets. How do we reconcile the "billionaire" with the "Texas girl"?

HOST_A: We reconcile it by looking at her actions. Does she use her wealth to insulate herself from reality, or does she use it to engage with it? She’s been very vocal about the "rule of law" regarding social media regulations. She’s met with the White House. She’s met with the Surgeon General. She’s not just sitting in a mansion; she’s engaging with the institutions that govern our lives. To me, that is how you stay grounded. You stay involved in the "working" part of the world. You don't just become a consumer of luxury; you become a participant in the conversation about how we live.

HOST_B: I have a question about the "Only Murders" renewal. Season 5. That is a long run for a streaming show. It’s her, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. She’s the bridge between the "old guard" of Hollywood and the new generation. In the last day, there’s been a lot of talk about how she’s the "glue" of that show. What does that say about her ability to work within a team? We often think of these "moguls" as being all about themselves.

HOST_A: It says she understands the value of "long-term stability." She found a project that works, she found partners she respects, and she is sticking with it. She isn't constantly looking for the "next big thing" if the current thing is excellent. That is a very pragmatic approach to a career. It’s like finding a good job with good colleagues and staying there for a decade. It’s not "flashy," but it builds a legacy. And it provides a steady stream of content for families who want to sit down and watch something together that isn't "extreme" or "edgy" just for the sake of it.

HOST_B: So, if we look at the last twenty-four hours as a snapshot, what is the "Selena Gomez" story? Is it the story of a girl who made it, or a woman who is redefining what "making it" looks like?

HOST_A: I think it’s the latter. It’s the story of someone who has moved past the "celebrity" phase and into the "stateswoman" phase of her career. Whether it’s business, film, or public health advocacy, she is operating at a level of high accountability. She is being honest about the "edge cases" of her life—her health, her inability to carry children—and she is converging those personal truths with her professional goals. She is showing that you can be a "billionaire" and still be a human being who struggles.

HOST_B: I’ll admit, Gary, I came into this a bit more skeptical. I saw the "billionaire" headlines and thought, "Here we go again." But looking at the Variety and Hollywood Reporter pieces from the last two days, there is a consistency there. She isn't trying to sell a fantasy. She’s selling a reality that happens to be very successful. I still think the Benny Blanco obsession in the press is a bit much, but I suppose that’s the tax you pay for being that famous.

HOST_A: It is a high tax, Margaret. But she seems to be paying it with grace. As we wrap up, I think about my own kids. I want them to see examples of people who work hard, who take care of their health, and who don't forget where they came from, even if they end up in a custom gown at a gala. Selena Gomez, at least in the last twenty-four hours, seems to be providing that example. She is choosing "stability" over "stardom," and "craft" over "clout." And in my book, that’s a win for the working families who just want some honest stories and some decent products.

HOST_B: And maybe a good musical about a cartel leader?

HOST_A: If the reviews are right, Margaret, maybe even that. I might have to get a babysitter for the kids and the guinea pigs and go see it.

HOST_B: I’ll hold you to that, Gary.

HOST_A: That is our look at the latest on Selena Gomez. A busy twenty-four hours for her, and a lot for us to think about regarding wealth, health, and the evolution of a career. We will be back tomorrow with more grounded perspectives on the news that shapes our world. I am Gary Thompson.

HOST_B: And I am Margaret Butcher. Thank you for listening.
