Gary Thompson: Selena Gomez is dominating the news cycle today following the Los Angeles premiere of Wizards Beyond Waverly Place.
Margaret Butcher: That is right. On October 24, 2024, Gomez hit the red carpet at the El Capitan Theatre in a custom red Rodarte dress. She was joined by her former co-star David Henrie to celebrate this new sequel series.
Gary Thompson: Gomez is not just guest-starring; she is an executive producer. She mentioned her goal is to provide a safe environment for the new cast, including lead actress Janice LeAnn Brown.
Margaret Butcher: It is a significant return to her roots. The show hits Disney Channel on October 29 and Disney Plus the next day. This comes as she balances a massive career shift.
Gary Thompson: Indeed. While she revisits Disney, she is also gaining serious Oscar buzz for her role in the film Emilia Pérez. Critics are calling her a frontrunner for Best Supporting Actress.
Margaret Butcher: It is a busy time. Between her billionaire status from Rare Beauty and her television success with Only Murders in the Building, she is managing a multi-billion dollar empire while staying selective with her acting projects.
Gary Thompson: She is certainly proving that a former child star succeeds.
