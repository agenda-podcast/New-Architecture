Gary Thompson: Selena Gomez is making major waves in Georgia this week. On October 23, 2024, she attended the SCAD Savannah Film Festival to receive the prestigious Virtuoso Award. This honor recognizes her standout performance in the new film Emilia Pérez.
Margaret Butcher: That is right. Directed by Jacques Audiard, this Spanish language musical features Selena as Jessi, the wife of a cartel leader. It is a bold career pivot that has critics buzzing about a potential Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. During her time in Savannah, Selena wore an elegant black gown and spent time mentoring students, emphasizing that vulnerability is a strength.
Gary Thompson: She also spoke candidly with Variety and The Hollywood Reporter about the challenges of this role. She admitted to being terrified because she had to sing in Spanish, a process she worked incredibly hard to reclaim.
Margaret Butcher: It is not just about the acting, though. Selena is balancing this awards push with her billion dollar brand, Rare Beauty, and her mental health advocacy through the Rare Impact Fund. With the film hitting Netflix on November 13, she is effectively dominating the film and music cycles.
Gary Thompson: She is proving that consistent work and professional accountability lead to success.
