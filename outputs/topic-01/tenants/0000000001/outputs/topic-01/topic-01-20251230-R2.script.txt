Gary Thompson: Is Selena Gomez the new frontrunner for an Oscar? The buzz reached a fever pitch on October 23, 2024, at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival. Selena was honored with the Virtuoso Award for her role in Emilia Pérez, a genre bending musical directed by Jacques Audiard.
Margaret Butcher: This film is a massive risk. Selena plays Jessi, the wife of a cartel leader, and she performs entirely in Spanish. She told Entertainment Weekly that singing in her native language was a different kind of vulnerability. She had to move past the notes to find the character's pain.
Gary Thompson: It is a level of professional maturity we have not seen before. Despite being the most followed woman on Instagram and running the successful Rare Beauty brand, she is treating her acting career like a serious trade. In Savannah, she even held a masterclass for students.
Margaret Butcher: She told those students that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. This aligns with her work for the Rare Impact Fund, which supports mental health services. However, she admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that the weight of expectations can be heavy.
Gary Thompson: With Emilia Pérez hitting Netflix on November 13, Selena is proving success.
