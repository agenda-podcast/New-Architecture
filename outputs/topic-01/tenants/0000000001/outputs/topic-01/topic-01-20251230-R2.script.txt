Gary Thompson: Beyond the red carpet, Selena Gomez is making headlines for her business acumen and personal transparency this week.
Margaret Butcher: That is right, Gary. Forbes and Bloomberg have updated their profiles on her wealth, confirming her billionaire status. Most of this net worth is driven by Rare Beauty, which is currently valued at over two billion dollars.
Gary Thompson: Interestingly, Gomez told reporters she finds talking about money "distasteful." She prefers to focus on the products and the philanthropy behind the brand.
Margaret Butcher: Her Rare Impact Fund is a major part of that, with a goal of raising one hundred million dollars for mental health services. It is a verified fact that she uses her platform for significant social impact.
Gary Thompson: She has also been very open about her personal life recently. This includes her relationship with Benny Blanco and her health struggles.
Margaret Butcher: She recently discussed her inability to carry her own children due to medical issues, turning a private tragedy into a public conversation about different paths to parenthood.
Gary Thompson: It is a pragmatic approach to fame. Whether she is executive producing television or managing a global beauty brand, she remains focused on accountability and her long-term legacy now.
