Gary Thompson: Selena Gomez is redefining what it means to be a public figure in 2024. She is no longer just a Disney alumna.
Margaret Butcher: Exactly. Between her billionaire status and her advocacy, she is showing immense accountability. Her Rare Impact Fund aims to raise one hundred million dollars for mental health services, funded partly by one percent of Rare Beauty sales.
Gary Thompson: That commitment to mental health is personal. She has been open about her bipolar diagnosis and the physical toll of lupus. In a recent Hollywood Reporter interview, she discussed the grief of learning she cannot safely carry her own children.
Margaret Butcher: It is that vulnerability that connects her to fans. Even her relationship with Benny Blanco has faced public scrutiny, but she has set firm boundaries, defending her personal choices as an adult.
Gary Thompson: She’s also shining professionally. At the Academy Museum Gala, she looked every bit the classic Hollywood star. With Only Murders in the Building renewed for season five and her film Emilia Pérez receiving rave reviews, her career is incredibly stable.
Margaret Butcher: She is proving you can manage a massive business while pursuing challenging art. She is choosing her own path and her own future.
