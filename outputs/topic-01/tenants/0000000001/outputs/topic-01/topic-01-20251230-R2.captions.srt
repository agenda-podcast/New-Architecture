00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,863
Selena Gomez is redefining what
it means to be a
public figure in 2024. She

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,133
is no longer just a
Disney alumna.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:12,496
Exactly. Between her billionaire status
and her advocacy, she is
showing immense accountability. Her Rare

4
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:17,360
Impact Fund aims to raise
one hundred million dollars for
mental health services, funded partly

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,629
by one percent of Rare
Beauty sales.

6
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,992
That commitment to mental health
is personal. She has been
open about her bipolar diagnosis

7
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:29,856
and the physical toll of
lupus. In a recent Hollywood
Reporter interview, she discussed the

8
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,098
grief of learning she cannot
safely carry her own children.

9
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:38,461
It is that vulnerability that
connects her to fans. Even
her relationship with Benny Blanco

10
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:43,325
has faced public scrutiny, but
she has set firm boundaries,
defending her personal choices as

11
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:43,973
an adult.

12
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:49,336
She’s also shining professionally. At
the Academy Museum Gala, she
looked every bit the classic

13
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:54,200
Hollywood star. With Only Murders
in the Building renewed for
season five and her film

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,442
Emilia Pérez receiving rave reviews,
her career is incredibly stable.

15
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:02,805
She is proving you can
manage a massive business while
pursuing challenging art. She is

16
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,399
choosing her own path and
her own future.
