00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,929
Beyond the red carpet, Selena
Gomez is making headlines for
her business acumen and personal

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:05,915
transparency this week.

3
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:11,345
That is right, Gary. Forbes
and Bloomberg have updated their
profiles on her wealth, confirming

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:16,274
her billionaire status. Most of
this net worth is driven
by Rare Beauty, which is

5
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:18,574
currently valued at over two
billion dollars.

6
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:24,004
Interestingly, Gomez told reporters she
finds talking about money "distasteful."
She prefers to focus on

7
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,633
the products and the philanthropy
behind the brand.

8
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:32,062
Her Rare Impact Fund is
a major part of that,
with a goal of raising

9
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:36,992
one hundred million dollars for
mental health services. It is
a verified fact that she

10
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:39,292
uses her platform for significant
social impact.

11
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:44,722
She has also been very
open about her personal life
recently. This includes her relationship

12
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:47,022
with Benny Blanco and her
health struggles.

13
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:52,451
She recently discussed her inability
to carry her own children
due to medical issues, turning

14
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:56,395
a private tragedy into a
public conversation about different paths
to parenthood.

15
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:01,824
It is a pragmatic approach
to fame. Whether she is
executive producing television or managing

16
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:06,425
a global beauty brand, she
remains focused on accountability and
her long-term legacy now.
