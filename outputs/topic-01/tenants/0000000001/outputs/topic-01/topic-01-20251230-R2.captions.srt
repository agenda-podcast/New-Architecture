1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,764
We are looking at Selena
Gomez today, who seems to
have found a perfect balance

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,305
between her business empire and
her personal life.

3
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:12,569
It is a fascinating evolution,
Gary. Her company, Rare Beauty,
is now valued at approximately

4
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:17,334
two billion dollars. She has
resisted selling it, showing she
is focused on long-term growth

5
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,922
rather than a quick payday.

6
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:24,186
That level of institutional thinking
is rare in the celebrity
world. She is also using

7
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,409
her platform for something substantial
with Wondermind.

8
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:31,673
Yes, she is very vocal
about mental health advocacy. Her
Rare Impact Fund has a

9
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:36,438
goal of raising one hundred
million dollars for services. It
is about de-stigmatizing the conversation

10
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:37,073
for everyone.

11
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:42,337
And she is still very
active in her craft. The
buzz from Cannes for Emilia

12
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:43,290
Pérez is huge.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,554
It really is. She shared
a Best Actress ensemble award
there. She is also preparing

14
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:53,318
to play Linda Ronstadt in
an upcoming biopic. Between that
and Only Murders in the

15
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:56,494
Building Season 4 returning August
27th, her schedule is packed.

16
00:00:56,994 --> 00:01:01,759
Yet, she still finds time
for her personal life, sharing
new photos with boyfriend Benny

17
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,712
Blanco just yesterday.

18
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:04,482
She is truly happy.
