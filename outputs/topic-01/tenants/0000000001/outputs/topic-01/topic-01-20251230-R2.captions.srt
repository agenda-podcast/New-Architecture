00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Is Selena Gomez the new
frontrunner for an Oscar? The
buzz reached a fever pitch

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,761
on October 23, 2024, at
the SCAD Savannah Film Festival.
Selena was honored with the

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:14,641
Virtuoso Award for her role
in Emilia Pérez, a genre
bending musical directed by Jacques

4
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:14,967
Audiard.

5
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:20,347
This film is a massive
risk. Selena plays Jessi, the
wife of a cartel leader,

6
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:25,228
and she performs entirely in
Spanish. She told Entertainment Weekly
that singing in her native

7
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:30,108
language was a different kind
of vulnerability. She had to
move past the notes to

8
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:31,410
find the character's pain.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,790
It is a level of
professional maturity we have not
seen before. Despite being the

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,671
most followed woman on Instagram
and running the successful Rare
Beauty brand, she is treating

11
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:46,551
her acting career like a
serious trade. In Savannah, she
even held a masterclass for

12
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:46,876
students.

13
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:52,257
She told those students that
vulnerability is a strength, not
a weakness. This aligns with

14
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:57,137
her work for the Rare
Impact Fund, which supports mental
health services. However, she admitted

15
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:01,042
to The Hollywood Reporter that
the weight of expectations can
be heavy.

16
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:05,446
With Emilia Pérez hitting Netflix
on November 13, Selena is
proving success.
