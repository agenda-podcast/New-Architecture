00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,088
Selena Gomez is dominating headlines
today with a mix of
personal joy and professional triumphs.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,141
Margaret, what is the latest
from her social media?

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:13,730
Gary, Selena shared a "life
lately" update June 17th, featuring
sweet photos with boyfriend Benny

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,818
Blanco. It shows a stable
chapter for her. But the
real news is her career

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:23,907
momentum. She recently shared the
Best Actress ensemble prize at
the Cannes Film Festival for

6
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:26,620
her role in the musical
noir Emilia Pérez.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,209
That is a significant shift
from her pop roots. It
seems she is leaning into

8
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:33,905
serious acting and producing now.

9
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:39,493
Exactly. She mentioned having perhaps
one more album left before
focusing on acting full-time. Plus,

10
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:44,582
Only Murders in the Building
Season 4 premieres August 27th.
The production even moved to

11
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:45,939
Los Angeles this time.

12
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,527
She is also a powerhouse
in business. Rare Beauty is
now valued near two billion

13
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:51,866
dollars.

14
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:57,455
It is incredible. She is
set to produce and star
in the Linda Ronstadt biopic,

15
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:02,543
bridging her musical past with
her cinematic future. She is
building long-term equity while maintaining

16
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:07,632
her mental health advocacy through
her platform, Wondermind. She is
firing on all cylinders right

17
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:08,310
now, Gary.
