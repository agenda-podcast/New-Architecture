Selena Gomez is hitting a
serious new stride this October.
Beyond the headlines, she’s navigating

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:06,428
a massive career evolution.

3
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:12,003
That’s right. Bloomberg recently labeled
her a billionaire, primarily due
to the success of Rare

4
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:17,079
Beauty, now valued at over
two billion dollars. Interestingly, she
told reporters she finds that

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,462
specific title distasteful and prefers
focusing on her brand’s impact.

6
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:26,037
She’s also pivoting toward serious
acting. Her role in the
new musical Emilia Pérez is

7
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:31,112
generating genuine Oscar buzz. Critics
are calling her performance revelatory
as she plays a character

8
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:33,480
far removed from her pop
star persona.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,055
She even mentioned to Variety
that she might only have
one more album left in

10
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:44,130
her. She wants to be
taken seriously as an actress,
moving away from the safe

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,205
lanes like Only Murders in
the Building, which was just
renewed for a fifth season.

12
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:54,781
It’s a pragmatic shift. She’s
balancing a massive empire with
passion projects while managing her

13
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,119
health.

14
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,694
Speaking of health, she’s been
incredibly candid lately about her
struggles with lupus and her

15
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:04,416
kidney transplant, even sharing that
she cannot carry her own
children.

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:08,299
Her honesty de-stigmatizes these issues
for many families. She’s evolving.
