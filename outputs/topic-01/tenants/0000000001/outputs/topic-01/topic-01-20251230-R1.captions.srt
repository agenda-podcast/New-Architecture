1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,904
Selena Gomez is dominating the
news cycle today following the
Los Angeles premiere of Wizards

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:05,884
Beyond Waverly Place.

3
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:11,288
That is right. On October
24, 2024, Gomez hit the
red carpet at the El

4
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:16,192
Capitan Theatre in a custom
red Rodarte dress. She was
joined by her former co-star

5
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:18,807
David Henrie to celebrate this
new sequel series.

6
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:24,210
Gomez is not just guest-starring;
she is an executive producer.
She mentioned her goal is

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,114
to provide a safe environment
for the new cast, including
lead actress Janice LeAnn Brown.

8
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:34,518
It is a significant return
to her roots. The show
hits Disney Channel on October

9
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:39,421
29 and Disney Plus the
next day. This comes as
she balances a massive career

10
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:39,748
shift.

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:45,152
Indeed. While she revisits Disney,
she is also gaining serious
Oscar buzz for her role

12
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:50,055
in the film Emilia Pérez.
Critics are calling her a
frontrunner for Best Supporting Actress.

13
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:55,459
It is a busy time.
Between her billionaire status from
Rare Beauty and her television

14
00:00:55,459 --> 00:01:00,362
success with Only Murders in
the Building, she is managing
a multi-billion dollar empire while

15
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,324
staying selective with her acting
projects.

16
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:06,093
She is certainly proving that
a former child star succeeds.
