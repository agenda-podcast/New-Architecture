00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,203
Selena Gomez is making major
waves in Georgia this week.
On October 23, 2024, she

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:10,405
attended the SCAD Savannah Film
Festival to receive the prestigious
Virtuoso Award. This honor recognizes

3
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:13,527
her standout performance in the
new film Emilia Pérez.

4
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:19,229
That is right. Directed by
Jacques Audiard, this Spanish language
musical features Selena as Jessi,

5
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:24,432
the wife of a cartel
leader. It is a bold
career pivot that has critics

6
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:29,635
buzzing about a potential Supporting
Actress Oscar nomination. During her
time in Savannah, Selena wore

7
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:34,837
an elegant black gown and
spent time mentoring students, emphasizing
that vulnerability is a strength.

8
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:40,540
She also spoke candidly with
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter
about the challenges of this

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,742
role. She admitted to being
terrified because she had to
sing in Spanish, a process

10
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:47,824
she worked incredibly hard to
reclaim.

11
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:53,526
It is not just about
the acting, though. Selena is
balancing this awards push with

12
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:58,729
her billion dollar brand, Rare
Beauty, and her mental health
advocacy through the Rare Impact

13
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:03,931
Fund. With the film hitting
Netflix on November 13, she
is effectively dominating the film

14
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,972
and music cycles.

15
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:09,634
She is proving that consistent
work and professional accountability lead
to success.
