1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,976
Good morning from the studio.
It is October 20, 2024.
I am Gary Thompson. I

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:05,952
am sitting here in Jersey
City after a somewhat chaotic
commute from South Brooklyn. My

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,928
two cats decided to have
a wrestling match at 4:00
AM, and the guinea pigs

4
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:11,905
were not much quieter. But
we are here, we are
grounded, and we are looking

5
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:14,881
at the news through a
lens of what actually matters
to working families and the

6
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,857
stability of our culture. Today,
we are talking about a
figure who has been in

7
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:20,833
the headlines for over a
decade but seems to be
hitting a new, more serious

8
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,809
stride in the last twenty-four
hours. I am talking about
Selena Gomez. Margaret, you have

9
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,785
been looking at the latest
reports coming out of the
Academy Museum Gala last night

10
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:29,166
and some of these deep-dive
interviews. What is the temperature
right now?

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,642
It is high, Gary. Very
high. I have my notes
here, and it is interesting

12
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:35,618
because we are seeing a
convergence of three different Selenas.
We have the business mogul

13
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,595
who was recently tagged with
the billionaire label by Bloomberg,
the actor who is currently

14
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:41,571
receiving genuine Oscar buzz for
a very risky film called
Emilia Pérez, and the public

15
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:44,547
figure who is being incredibly
candid about her personal health
and her future. Last night

16
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:47,523
at the Academy Museum Gala
in Los Angeles, she was
one of the central figures.

17
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:50,499
But I want to start
with something you usually care
about: the money and the

18
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:53,475
accountability. She recently spoke to
Bloomberg and then followed up
in the last day about

19
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:56,451
this billionaire status. She said
it makes her uncomfortable. She
said she finds it distasteful

20
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:59,428
to talk about money. Gary,
as someone who values the
working-class perspective, does that ring

21
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:01,213
true to you, or is
that just good PR?

22
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:04,689
It is a complicated one,
Margaret. When you are a
naturalized citizen like I am,

23
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,666
you see the American dream
as something to be achieved
through hard work and providing

24
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,642
a service. Rare Beauty, her
company, is valued at over
two billion dollars. Most of

25
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:13,618
her wealth comes from that,
not her singing or acting.
When she says it is

26
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,594
distasteful to talk about, I
think there is a pragmatic
side to that. She knows

27
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:19,570
that in a time when
people in my neighborhood in
Brooklyn are struggling with rent

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,546
and the cost of groceries,
flaunting a ten-figure net worth
is a quick way to

29
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:25,522
lose your audience. But I
look at the accountability. She
has the Rare Impact Fund.

30
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:28,499
She is trying to raise
a hundred million dollars for
mental health. To me, the

31
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,475
"distaste" for the title is
less important than what the
money is doing. If she

32
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:34,451
is using that platform to
stabilize mental health services, which
are a public safety issue

33
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,427
and a family stability issue,
then I am inclined to
give her the benefit of

34
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:40,403
the doubt. But you are
the skeptic. Do you think
she is just trying to

35
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:40,800
stay relatable?

36
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,276
I think it is a
bit of both. I am
looking at a report from

37
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,252
Variety published yesterday where she
discusses her role in Emilia
Pérez. This is a film

38
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:50,228
about a Mexican cartel leader
who seeks gender-affirming surgery and
a new life. It is

39
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,204
a musical. It is bold.
It is the kind of
project a "safe" pop star

40
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:56,181
avoids. If she were just
worried about her brand as
a relatable billionaire, she would

41
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,157
stay in the Only Murders
in the Building lane, which
is very safe, very cozy.

42
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:02,133
But she is pushing into
these spaces that are controversial.
She told Variety that she

43
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,109
is not even sure if
she wants to continue with
music full-time because she wants

44
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,085
to be taken seriously as
an actor. My question for
you, Gary, is about that

45
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,061
transition. We see celebrities try
to "pivot" all the time
to stay relevant. Is this

46
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:13,839
a genuine career evolution, or
is she just bored with
the pop star life?

47
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:17,315
I think we have to
look at the work ethic.
She has been working since

48
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:20,291
she was a child on
Barney and then Disney. For
a person in their early

49
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,268
thirties to have that kind
of longevity, there has to
be a level of discipline.

50
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,244
In the last twenty-four hours,
the reviews for Emilia Pérez
coming out of the UK

51
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:29,220
screenings have been calling her
performance "revelatory." The Guardian gave
it a strong review, specifically

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,196
mentioning her ability to disappear
into a role that isn't
"Selena Gomez." To me, that

53
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:35,172
speaks to a respect for
the craft. It is like
any trade. If you are

54
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,148
a plumber for twenty years
and then you decide to
become a contractor, you are

55
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:41,124
building on your experience. She
is not just jumping into
this; she has been doing

56
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:44,100
the work. And she is
doing it while managing lupus
and a kidney transplant. That

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,077
brings me to the Hollywood
Reporter piece from Friday that
is still circulating today. She

58
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:49,656
was very open about the
fact that she cannot carry
her own children.

59
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:53,132
That was a very heavy
moment in the interview. She
mentioned that due to her

60
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,108
medical issues, she would have
to use a surrogate or
adopt. She said she had

61
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:59,084
to "grieve" that reality. Now,
Gary, I’m going to play
the skeptic here. We live

62
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:02,061
in an era of oversharing.
Does a global superstar need
to tell us about her

63
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,037
reproductive health? Does it help
the public discourse, or is
it just more fuel for

64
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:05,830
the celebrity gossip engine?

65
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,306
I look at it through
the lens of my own
family. I have three kids.

66
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:12,283
My wife and I know
how central that is to
our lives. When someone with

67
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:15,259
a platform like hers speaks
about the reality of medical
limitations, it de-stigmatizes it for

68
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,235
regular families who are going
through the same thing. There
are thousands of people in

69
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:21,211
the UK and the US
right now dealing with the
same heartbreak. When she says,

70
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:24,187
"It’s not necessarily the way
I envisioned it," she is
being honest about the fact

71
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:27,163
that life doesn't follow a
script. That is a very
grounded, very pragmatic thing to

72
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:30,139
say. It rejects the "extremism"
of the perfect celebrity life.
It says, "I have a

73
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,116
billion dollars, but I still
have to deal with the
rule of biology." I think

74
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:36,092
that kind of honesty actually
builds a more stable relationship
with her audience. It’s not

75
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,869
just "look at my shiny
life." It’s "here is the
reality of my body."

76
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:42,346
It is interesting you mention
the "perfect life" because her
relationship with Benny Blanco is

77
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:45,322
also all over the news
today. People Magazine just updated
their timeline of their relationship

78
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:48,298
this morning. They were seen
together recently, and the public
reaction is... mixed. Some people

79
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:51,274
are very critical of him,
his appearance, his personality. Selena
has been very defensive of

80
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,250
him. She basically told her
fans to back off. Is
that a wise move for

81
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,226
someone who relies on public
sentiment for her business? Or
is she finally setting boundaries

82
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,020
that we should respect?

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,496
Boundaries are essential for long-term
stability, Margaret. If you let
the "mob" or the "fandom"

84
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:04,472
dictate who you sit at
the dinner table with, you
have no personal life. You

85
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:07,448
have no foundation. As a
father, I tell my kids
that you have to stand

86
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,424
up for the people you
care about, even if it’s
not popular. If she is

87
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,401
happy and this relationship provides
her with the support she
needs while she deals with

88
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:16,377
her health and her career,
then the public’s opinion on
his "vibe" is irrelevant. It’s

89
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:19,353
about accountability to oneself. She
is saying, "I am an
adult, I am thirty-two years

90
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:22,329
old, and I make my
own choices." I respect that.
It’s a rejection of the

91
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,520
idea that celebrities are public
property.

92
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,996
Let’s talk about Only Murders
in the Building for a
second. Deadline reported a few

93
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,972
days ago that it’s been
renewed for Season 5, and
they are currently finishing up

94
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:32,948
the rollout of Season 4.
This show is a massive
hit. It’s a "cozy mystery."

95
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,924
It appeals to exactly the
demographic you talk about—families, people
who want something stable and

96
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:38,900
entertaining. How does she balance
being the "cozy" Mabel Mora
on Hulu with being this

97
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,876
"edgy" actor in a trans-themed
cartel musical? Isn't there a
risk of alienating the very

98
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:43,067
people who made her a
billionaire?

99
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:46,543
I don't think so. I
think the public is smarter
than we give them credit

100
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,519
for. We can enjoy a
cozy mystery on a Tuesday
night and then go to

101
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,495
the cinema to see a
challenging piece of art on
a Friday. What I see

102
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:55,471
is a woman who is
diversifying her "portfolio," so to
speak. She has the Rare

103
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:58,448
Beauty business which is her
financial bedrock. She has the
TV show which is her

104
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,424
steady "job." And she has
the films which are her
"passion projects." That is a

105
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,400
very pragmatic way to run
a career. It’s like having
a 401k, a steady paycheck,

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,376
and a side business. It’s
a model of stability. She
isn't betting everything on one

107
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:07,576
thing.

108
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:11,052
But what about the music?
She told Variety in that
interview yesterday that she might

109
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:14,028
have "one more album" in
her. For her fans, the
"Selenators," that is a huge

110
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:17,004
blow. She’s a pop star
first for many of them.
If she walks away from

111
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:19,981
music, is she walking away
from the thing that gave
her a voice? Or is

112
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,766
she just being honest about
where her heart is?

113
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,242
She said in the interview
that she never intended to
be a full-time singer. She

114
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,218
started in acting and the
music just kind of happened.
I think there is something

115
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:31,195
to be said for knowing
when to close a chapter.
In our society, we are

116
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:34,171
often told to "grind" and
do everything until we burn
out. If she recognizes that

117
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,147
she doesn't have the same
passion for touring—especially with her
health concerns—then stopping is the

118
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:40,123
responsible thing to do. It’s
about long-term sustainability. If she
tours and gets sick, everything

119
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,099
else falls apart. Her business,
her acting, her health. Choosing
to focus on what she

120
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,488
can manage is a sign
of maturity.

121
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,964
I want to push back
on the "billionaire" thing one
more time. You mentioned the

122
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,940
Rare Impact Fund. Bloomberg’s report
notes that Rare Beauty donates
1% of all sales to

123
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,916
mental health. 1% sounds small
when you are talking about
billions. Is that enough? Or

124
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,694
is this just "philanthropy-washing" to
make us feel better about
buying a twenty-five-dollar blush?

125
00:05:57,194 --> 00:06:00,170
1% of a massive company
is still millions of dollars.
In the last year alone,

126
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,146
they have funded dozens of
organizations. Is it enough to
fix the mental health crisis?

127
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:06,123
No. But is it more
than most other beauty brands
are doing? Yes. We have

128
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:09,099
to look at the "rule
of law" and the standards
we set. If we demand

129
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,075
that every successful person solve
every problem, we end up
with nothing. I look at

130
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:15,051
the fact that she is
using her board meetings to
talk about surgeon general warnings

131
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,027
on social media for kids.
She is using her influence
to push for policy changes.

132
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:21,003
That is a form of
accountability that goes beyond just
writing a check. She is

133
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:23,186
using the "institutions" of her
business to advocate for public
safety.

134
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,662
It’s a fair point. I’m
looking at the photos from
the Academy Museum Gala again.

135
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:29,638
She was wearing this custom
black gown with white suede
lapels. She looked... like a

136
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:32,614
classic Hollywood star. Not a
Disney kid. Not a pop
star. A peer to the

137
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,590
Meryl Streeps and the Nicole
Kidmans who were also there.
There is a sense in

138
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,567
the last twenty-four hours that
the industry is finally seeing
her that way. But there

139
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,543
is also the "Benny Blanco
factor." He wasn't on the
carpet with her, but he

140
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:44,519
was mentioned in almost every
interview. Do you think the
media is obsessed with her

141
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,098
personal life because they can't
quite wrap their heads around
her business success?

142
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,574
Absolutely. It is easier to
talk about who she is
dating than to analyze the

143
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,550
supply chain and marketing strategy
of a billion-dollar cosmetics company.
It is easier to talk

144
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,527
about her "feuds" with other
celebrities—which she has repeatedly denied—than
to talk about her performance

145
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,503
in a Spanish-language musical. We
tend to trivialize successful women
by focusing on their relationships.

146
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,479
But if you look at
the facts of the last
twenty-four hours, the facts are:

147
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,455
she is a lead in
a major Oscar-contending film, she
is the head of a

148
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:08,431
massive company, and she is
using her platform to talk
about serious health issues. Those

149
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:10,415
are the "hard" news items.
The rest is just noise.

150
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:13,891
Let’s talk about the UK
perspective. Emilia Pérez is getting
a lot of traction in

151
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,868
the British press today. The
BBC had a feature on
it this morning. They are

152
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,844
calling it a "bold gamble"
for Netflix. In the UK,
there is often a bit

153
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:22,820
more skepticism toward the "American
celebrity mogul" type. But the
reviews there have been surprisingly

154
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,796
warm toward her. They are
highlighting her "vulnerability." Gary, why
does that word "vulnerability" keep

155
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,772
coming up with her? Is
it a curated image, or
is it something she can't

156
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:28,972
help?

157
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:32,448
I think it’s her "lived
experience," Margaret. When you have
been through a kidney transplant,

158
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:35,424
when you have been open
about a bipolar diagnosis, when
you have dealt with the

159
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:38,400
physical changes that come with
lupus medication—and you’ve done it
all in front of a

160
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,377
camera—you don't have the luxury
of a "perfect" image. She
has been forced to be

161
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,353
vulnerable. And in a world
that feels very fake, especially
on social media, that vulnerability

162
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:47,329
feels like a "plainspoken" truth.
It’s why people in my
neighborhood, people who don't care

163
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:50,305
about pop music, might still
respect her. She’s not pretending
that life is easy. She’s

164
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:53,281
saying, "I have all this
success, and I still have
to fight for my health

165
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,868
every day." That is a
very grounded message.

166
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:58,345
It’s interesting you mention the
"plainspoken" aspect. In her Variety
interview, she talked about how

167
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,321
she doesn't feel like she
"belongs" in the high-fashion, high-wealth
world sometimes. She said she

168
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:04,297
still feels like the girl
from Texas. Now, I’ve heard
every celebrity say that. "I’m

169
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:07,273
just a small-town girl." But
then they fly on private
jets. How do we reconcile

170
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,463
the "billionaire" with the "Texas
girl"?

171
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:11,940
We reconcile it by looking
at her actions. Does she
use her wealth to insulate

172
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,916
herself from reality, or does
she use it to engage
with it? She’s been very

173
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,892
vocal about the "rule of
law" regarding social media regulations.
She’s met with the White

174
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,868
House. She’s met with the
Surgeon General. She’s not just
sitting in a mansion; she’s

175
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,844
engaging with the institutions that
govern our lives. To me,
that is how you stay

176
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:26,820
grounded. You stay involved in
the "working" part of the
world. You don't just become

177
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,796
a consumer of luxury; you
become a participant in the
conversation about how we live.

178
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:33,273
I have a question about
the "Only Murders" renewal. Season
5. That is a long

179
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:36,249
run for a streaming show.
It’s her, Steve Martin, and
Martin Short. She’s the bridge

180
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,225
between the "old guard" of
Hollywood and the new generation.
In the last day, there’s

181
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:42,201
been a lot of talk
about how she’s the "glue"
of that show. What does

182
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:45,177
that say about her ability
to work within a team?
We often think of these

183
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:46,368
"moguls" as being all about
themselves.

184
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:49,844
It says she understands the
value of "long-term stability." She
found a project that works,

185
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:52,820
she found partners she respects,
and she is sticking with
it. She isn't constantly looking

186
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,796
for the "next big thing"
if the current thing is
excellent. That is a very

187
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:58,772
pragmatic approach to a career.
It’s like finding a good
job with good colleagues and

188
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,748
staying there for a decade.
It’s not "flashy," but it
builds a legacy. And it

189
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:04,724
provides a steady stream of
content for families who want
to sit down and watch

190
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,304
something together that isn't "extreme"
or "edgy" just for the
sake of it.

191
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:10,780
So, if we look at
the last twenty-four hours as
a snapshot, what is the

192
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,756
"Selena Gomez" story? Is it
the story of a girl
who made it, or a

193
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,542
woman who is redefining what
"making it" looks like?

194
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:19,018
I think it’s the latter.
It’s the story of someone
who has moved past the

195
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,994
"celebrity" phase and into the
"stateswoman" phase of her career.
Whether it’s business, film, or

196
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,970
public health advocacy, she is
operating at a level of
high accountability. She is being

197
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,946
honest about the "edge cases"
of her life—her health, her
inability to carry children—and she

198
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:30,922
is converging those personal truths
with her professional goals. She
is showing that you can

199
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:33,105
be a "billionaire" and still
be a human being who
struggles.

200
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:36,581
I’ll admit, Gary, I came
into this a bit more
skeptical. I saw the "billionaire"

201
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:39,557
headlines and thought, "Here we
go again." But looking at
the Variety and Hollywood Reporter

202
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:42,533
pieces from the last two
days, there is a consistency
there. She isn't trying to

203
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,510
sell a fantasy. She’s selling
a reality that happens to
be very successful. I still

204
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,486
think the Benny Blanco obsession
in the press is a
bit much, but I suppose

205
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,271
that’s the tax you pay
for being that famous.

206
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,748
It is a high tax,
Margaret. But she seems to
be paying it with grace.

207
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,724
As we wrap up, I
think about my own kids.
I want them to see

208
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:59,700
examples of people who work
hard, who take care of
their health, and who don't

209
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,676
forget where they came from,
even if they end up
in a custom gown at

210
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:05,652
a gala. Selena Gomez, at
least in the last twenty-four
hours, seems to be providing

211
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,628
that example. She is choosing
"stability" over "stardom," and "craft"
over "clout." And in my

212
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:11,604
book, that’s a win for
the working families who just
want some honest stories and

213
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:12,200
some decent products.

214
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,485
And maybe a good musical
about a cartel leader?

215
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,961
If the reviews are right,
Margaret, maybe even that. I
might have to get a

216
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,342
babysitter for the kids and
the guinea pigs and go
see it.

217
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:22,033
I’ll hold you to that,
Gary.

218
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,509
That is our look at
the latest on Selena Gomez.
A busy twenty-four hours for

219
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,485
her, and a lot for
us to think about regarding
wealth, health, and the evolution

220
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:31,461
of a career. We will
be back tomorrow with more
grounded perspectives on the news

221
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,048
that shapes our world. I
am Gary Thompson.

222
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:35,331
And I am Margaret Butcher.
Thank you for listening.
