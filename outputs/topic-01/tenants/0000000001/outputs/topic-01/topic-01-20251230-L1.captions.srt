1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
Good morning and welcome to
the program. It is Friday,
October 25, 2024. I am

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,480
Gary Thompson, coming to you
from our Jersey City studio.
We are looking at a

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,219
very busy news cycle in
the world of entertainment and
business today, specifically focusing on

4
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:10,959
a figure who seems to
be everywhere at once right
now. Selena Gomez. Now, I

5
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,699
will be the first to
admit that I am not
usually the one tracking pop

6
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,439
star movements, but when you
look at the sheer scale
of what she is doing

7
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:19,179
this week, from a major
television premiere in Los Angeles
last night to the mounting

8
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,918
Oscar buzz for her latest
film, it is hard to
ignore the sheer work ethic

9
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:24,658
on display. Joining me to
break this down is Margaret
Butcher. Margaret, you have been

10
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,398
looking at the reports coming
out of the El Capitan
Theatre from just a few

11
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:27,763
hours ago.

12
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:31,003
I have, Gary. And it
is quite a scene. Last
night, October 24, was the

13
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,743
official premiere of Wizards Beyond
Waverly Place. This is the
sequel series to the show

14
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,483
that originally put her on
the map back in 2007.
She was there on the

15
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:39,223
red carpet with her former
co-star David Henrie. It is
an interesting move, Gary. Usually,

16
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:41,962
when someone reaches the level
of success she has, they
try to distance themselves from

17
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:44,702
their Disney Channel roots. They
want to be seen as
serious actors or high-fashion icons.

18
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:47,442
But here she is, executive
producing and guest-starring in a
show for the next generation

19
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:50,182
of kids. I have to
ask, is this a genuine
moment of giving back, or

20
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,922
is this just a very
savvy way to maintain a
grip on a younger demographic

21
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,018
that fuels her Rare Beauty
empire?

22
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:57,257
Well, Margaret, I tend to
look at it through the
lens of stability and legacy.

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,997
In any other industry, if
a CEO went back to
the shop floor to mentor

24
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:02,737
the new hires, we would
call that good leadership. She
is forty-three years old in

25
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:05,477
spirit sometimes with the way
she talks about her responsibilities.
She told reporters on the

26
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:08,217
carpet last night that she
felt it was important to
ensure the new cast had

27
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,956
a safe and supportive environment,
something she has hinted was
not always the case during

28
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:13,696
the mid-2000s era of child
stardom. To me, that sounds
like someone who values the

29
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:16,436
institution that gave her a
start and wants to fix
the cracks in the foundation.

30
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:19,676
That is a very charitable
view, Gary. And I do
not disagree that she seems

31
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:22,416
sincere. She was wearing a
custom red Rodarte dress, looking
every bit the movie star,

32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,155
yet she was spending her
time talking about the young
actress Janice LeAnn Brown, who

33
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:27,895
is taking over the lead
role. But let us look
at the timing. This premiere

34
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:30,635
on October 24 happens right
as her film Emilia Pérez
is hitting a critical mass

35
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:33,375
in the awards conversation. There
is a claim being made
by several critics, and reported

36
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,115
by the BBC and Variety
yesterday, that she is a
frontrunner for a Best Supporting

37
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,854
Actress nomination. Is it possible
that the Wizards premiere is
part of a larger campaign

38
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,594
to show her range? From
a Disney mentor to a
gritty, Spanish-language musical about a

39
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:41,960
cartel leader?

40
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,199
It is a massive range,
certainly. But let us stick
to the facts of the

41
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,939
Wizards premiere first. The reports
from Deadline and The Hollywood
Reporter confirm that the show

42
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,679
premieres on Disney Channel on
October 29 and will be
on Disney+ the following day.

43
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,419
Gomez is an executive producer
here. That is a position
of accountability. She is not

44
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:56,159
just showing up for a
cameo; she is responsible for
the budget, the casting, and

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,898
the direction. In my house,
we talk about finishing what
you start. She started with

46
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:01,638
Wizards, and now she is
ensuring it continues properly. Margaret,
you mentioned the billionaire status

47
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,378
earlier. That has been a
huge part of the conversation
in the last twenty-four hours

48
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:04,743
as well.

49
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,983
It has. And this is
where I play the skeptic,
Gary. Forbes and Bloomberg have

50
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:10,723
both been updating their profiles
on her wealth this week.
She recently spoke to reporters

51
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:13,463
about this, and her quote
was quite interesting. She said
she finds it distasteful to

52
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:16,203
talk about money. She claimed
that she does not focus
on the numbers and that

53
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,942
she credits the people who
buy the products at Rare
Beauty for that success. Now,

54
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,682
Gary, you are a man
who values the rule of
law and financial transparency. Does

55
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:24,422
it sit well with you
when a billionaire says talking
about money is distasteful? It

56
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:26,796
feels a bit like a
deflection from the reality of
her massive influence.

57
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:30,036
I think there is a
middle ground there, Margaret. I
live in South Brooklyn. I

58
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,776
see people working two jobs
just to pay rent. If
a celebrity starts flaunting their

59
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:35,516
bank account, it creates a
disconnect. I actually find her
approach somewhat pragmatic. If she

60
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:38,256
is focused on the product
and the philanthropy, which is
a verified fact—the Rare Impact

61
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:40,995
Fund has a goal of
raising one hundred million dollars
for mental health services—then the

62
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,735
wealth is a byproduct of
a functioning business. She is
not a hedge fund manager;

63
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:46,475
she is selling a product
people clearly want. The reports
from yesterday indicate that Rare

64
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:49,215
Beauty is still the primary
driver of her net worth,
far more than her music

65
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:49,763
or acting contracts.

66
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:53,003
That is true. Rare Beauty
is valued at over two
billion dollars. But let us

67
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,742
look at the acting side
again, because that is where
the "fresh news" is really

68
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,482
heating up. Yesterday, October 24,
Netflix released more promotional material
for Emilia Pérez. This is

69
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,222
a film where she plays
the wife of a cartel
boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery.

70
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,962
It is a bold choice.
Some might even say it
is a risky choice for

71
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:06,702
someone with such a massive,
young fan base. Gary, you
often talk about public safety

72
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,441
and the rule of law.
This film deals with some
very heavy, dark themes. Do

73
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:12,181
you think her fans are
ready to follow her from
the Waverly Place substation to

74
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,095
the world of Mexican cartels?

75
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,334
I think the audience grows
up with the performer, Margaret.
That is the natural progression

76
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,074
of things. If she stayed
in the "Wizards" lane forever,
she would lose her relevance.

77
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,814
What I find interesting is
the report from Rolling Stone
yesterday where she discussed her

78
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,554
career shift. She mentioned that
she is becoming more selective.
She is not just taking

79
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,294
every role offered. She is
looking for projects that challenge
the status quo. Now, I

80
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,033
am not one for extremism
in any form, but I
do appreciate an artist who

81
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,773
wants to push their own
boundaries. The fact is, she
is managing a multi-billion dollar

82
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,513
company while also being a
top-tier contender for an Oscar.
That requires a level of

83
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:36,792
discipline that I think we
should respect.

84
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:40,031
Discipline, yes. But let us
talk about the personal narrative
she is projecting. In the

85
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,771
last twenty-four hours, there has
been a lot of social
media chatter about her relationship

86
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:45,511
with Benny Blanco. They have
been very public lately. Some
critics claim this is a

87
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:48,251
"PR relationship" to keep her
in the headlines during awards
season. Others say it is

88
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,991
the most stable she has
ever looked. Gary, you are
a family man. You have

89
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:53,730
three kids. You value long-term
stability. When you see a
public figure like Gomez being

90
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,470
so open about her personal
life, does it feel like
she is building a stable

91
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,297
foundation, or is it just
more content for the machine?

92
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:01,537
It is a fine line,
Margaret. But look at the
history. She has been in

93
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:04,276
the public eye since she
was seven or eight years
old. She has dealt with

94
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:07,016
lupus, a kidney transplant, and
very public breakups. If she
is finding stability now, at

95
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,756
thirty-two, I think that is
a positive for her brand
and her health. The facts

96
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:12,496
are that she has been
very transparent about her health
struggles. Yesterday, there were follow-up

97
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:15,236
reports on her comments regarding
her inability to carry her
own children due to medical

98
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:17,975
issues. She has turned what
could be a private tragedy
into a public conversation about

99
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:20,715
the different ways people can
become parents. That is not
"content" in the cynical sense;

100
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:23,272
that is using a platform
to normalize a very common
struggle for many families.

101
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:26,512
I will give you that,
Gary. It is a powerful
message. But I want to

102
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:29,252
go back to the Wizards
premiere for a moment. There
was a specific moment on

103
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,992
the carpet where she was
asked about the future of
the franchise. She said she

104
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,732
wants this to be something
that lasts for years, not
just a one-off. This brings

105
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,471
up the question of over-saturation.
We have Only Murders in
the Building, which just wrapped

106
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:40,211
its fourth season and has
been renewed for a fifth.
We have the new Wizards

107
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,951
show. We have the movie
Emilia Pérez. We have the
beauty brand. We have the

108
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,691
music she keeps hinting at.
Is there a point where
the Selena Gomez brand becomes

109
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:47,700
too big to fail, or
worse, too big to be
interesting?

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,940
That is the risk of
any major institution, Margaret. But
as long as there is

111
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,680
accountability, it works. She is
the common thread. If the
quality of the work stays

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,419
high—and the reviews for Only
Murders and Emilia Pérez suggest
it is—then the market will

113
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,159
sustain it. I look at
it like a local business
that expands. If they keep

114
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,899
the quality of the coffee
the same, I do not
care if they have one

115
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,639
shop or ten. The problem
arises when the person at
the top loses sight of

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,379
the work. From everything we
saw yesterday at the premiere,
she seems more engaged with

117
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,571
the "work" of being a
producer and a mentor than
ever before.

118
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:12,810
It is also worth noting
the regional focus here. In
the UK, Emilia Pérez has

119
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,550
been getting a lot of
traction in the broadsheets. The
Guardian and the BBC have

120
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,290
both run pieces in the
last twenty-four hours discussing how
she is breaking the "pop

121
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,030
star turned actor" curse. In
the US, the focus is
much more on the Disney

122
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,770
nostalgia and her business success.
It is a two-pronged attack
on the global market. She

123
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,509
is winning over the high-brow
critics in Europe and the
suburban families in the US.

124
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,971
It is a very calculated,
very effective strategy.

125
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:31,210
Calculated does not have to
be a dirty word, Margaret.
It can mean well-planned. It

126
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,950
can mean responsible. We want
our public figures to be
responsible. We want them to

127
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,690
have a plan. I would
much rather see this level
of professional execution than the

128
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,430
chaotic, self-destructive behavior we see
from other stars. She is
providing jobs for hundreds of

129
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,170
people on these sets and
in her company. That is
a contribution to the economy

130
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,083
that we should not overlook.

131
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,323
I suppose I am just
waiting for the other shoe
to drop. It feels almost

132
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:49,062
too perfect right now. The
billionaire status, the Oscar buzz,
the successful TV return, the

133
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,802
happy relationship. In the world
of celebrity news, we are
conditioned to look for the

134
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:54,542
crack in the armor. But
you are right, Gary. If
we look at the verified

135
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,282
facts from the last twenty-four
hours, there is no scandal.
There is just a lot

136
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:59,108
of work being premiered and
a lot of positive reception.

137
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,348
And that is where we
should leave it. The facts
are these: Selena Gomez executive

138
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:05,088
produced and attended the premiere
of Wizards Beyond Waverly Place
on October 24, 2024. She

139
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,828
is currently receiving critical acclaim
for her role in Emilia
Pérez. Her company, Rare Beauty,

140
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:10,568
continues to be a leader
in the industry both financially
and philanthropically. She is navigating

141
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,307
a complex career with a
level of pragmatism that is
rare in Hollywood. Whether you

142
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,047
are a fan of the
music or not, the business
and professional model she is

143
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,056
building is something to watch.
Margaret, thank you for the
perspective.

144
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:21,114
Always a pleasure, Gary. I
will keep my notes ready
