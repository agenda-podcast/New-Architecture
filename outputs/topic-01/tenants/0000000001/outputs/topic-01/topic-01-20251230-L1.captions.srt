1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,297
Good morning from a slightly
humid South Brooklyn. I am
Gary Thompson, and you are

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:06,594
listening to the morning briefing.
I just finished my commute
over to Jersey City, and

3
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:09,891
I have to tell you,
the PATH train was packed
today, but it gave me

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:13,189
some time to catch up
on the headlines. Before we
dive into the heavy lifting

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:16,486
of the day, I was
checking in on my guinea
pigs, Pesto and Beans, and

6
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:19,783
I realized that even in
a quiet house with two
cats and three kids, there

7
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:23,080
is a certain rhythm to
life that we all try
to maintain. Stability is something

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,377
I talk about a lot
on this show. It is
the bedrock of a functioning

9
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:29,674
society and a functioning life.
And that brings me to
our topic today. We are

10
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:32,972
looking at someone who has
been in the public eye
for two decades and seems

11
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:36,269
to have finally found a
balance between her professional output
and her personal stability. I

12
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,566
am talking about Selena Gomez.
Margaret, you have been tracking
the social media movements and

13
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:42,863
the trade reports over the
last twenty-four hours. What is
the latest on the Gomez

14
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:43,083
front?

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,880
It is a busy window
for her, Gary. If you
looked at Instagram late last

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,177
night, June 17th, or early
this morning, June 18th, you
would have seen what she

17
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:53,474
is calling a life lately
update. It is a series
of photos that really leans

18
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:56,771
into her relationship with music
producer Benny Blanco. Now, I
know you usually prefer to

19
00:00:56,771 --> 00:01:00,069
stick to the hard economic
data or the rule of
law, but in the world

20
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,366
of entertainment and brand management,
these personal glimpses are strategic
assets. We are seeing her

21
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:06,663
very publicly happy, which is
a sharp contrast to the
narrative of struggle that defined

22
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:09,960
her mid-twenties. But beyond the
domestic bliss, we have some
very real movement on her

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,718
film career and her business
empire, Rare Beauty.

24
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:15,516
Let us start with the
work. I have always said
that accountability in your profession

25
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:18,813
is what earns you a
seat at the table. Gomez
started as a child actor,

26
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:22,110
moved into pop music, and
now she is being taken
very seriously in rooms that

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,407
used to ignore her. The
buzz from the Cannes Film
Festival is still echoing. She

28
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:28,704
shared a Best Actress ensemble
prize for Emilia Pérez. That
is a Jacques Audiard film,

29
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:32,001
a musical noir about a
Mexican cartel leader. That is
a long way from the

30
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,661
Disney Channel, Margaret.

31
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,458
It is a massive pivot.
And I will play the
skeptic here for a second,

32
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,755
Gary. Is she a great
actress, or is she a
great celebrity who fits a

33
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:43,052
specific mold for international directors
looking for American distribution? The
film Emilia Pérez was the

34
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:46,349
talk of Cannes back in
May, and the momentum hasn't
slowed down. Critics are saying

35
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,647
this is her career-best performance.
But we have to ask,
is this a one-off, or

36
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:52,944
is she actually transitioning away
from being a pop star?
She told the press recently

37
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:56,241
that she feels she has
one more album in her
before she wants to settle

38
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:56,900
into acting full-time.

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,697
I respect that. There is
a pragmatism in knowing when
to shift gears. In my

40
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:03,995
line of work, and in
the lives of the working
families I talk to in

41
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,292
Brooklyn, you have to know
when a certain chapter is
closing so you can invest

42
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,589
in the next one. If
she stays in music just
for the sake of the

43
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,886
charts, she risks burnout. If
she moves into acting and
producing—like she does with Only

44
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:17,183
Murders in the Building—she is
building long-term equity. Speaking of
that show, we have a

45
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:18,502
confirmed date for Season 4,
right?

46
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:22,299
We do. August 27th. The
production has moved to Los
Angeles for part of the

47
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,596
season, which is a big
change for a show that
is so rooted in New

48
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,894
York. But back to your
point about equity, Gary. Let’s
look at Rare Beauty. There

49
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:32,191
were reports earlier this year,
and reinforced in recent Forbes
analysis, that the company is

50
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,488
being valued in the two-billion-dollar
range. She has resisted the
urge to sell it off

51
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,785
quickly. That shows a level
of institutional thinking that you
usually appreciate. She isn't just

52
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,082
looking for a quick payday;
she’s building a brand that
has stayed relevant for four

53
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:44,280
years, which is an eternity
in the celebrity makeup world.

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,077
It is about the product.
My wife uses some of
those products, and she isn't

55
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:51,375
someone who buys into celebrity
hype. She buys it because
it works and it is

56
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,672
priced for people who actually
have a budget. That is
the kind of business model

57
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:57,969
that survives a recession. It
is grounded. Now, Margaret, you
mentioned those photos with Benny

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,266
Blanco. You called them strategic.
Explain that to me. I
see a woman in her

59
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,563
thirties posting photos with her
boyfriend. Why is that a
news item for us today?

60
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:08,360
Because in the last twenty-four
hours, those photos have generated
millions of engagements. In the

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,658
digital economy, engagement is currency.
But there is a deeper
layer. For years, the public

62
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,955
narrative around Selena Gomez was
tied to her ex-partners or
her health struggles—her lupus diagnosis

63
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:18,252
and her kidney transplant. By
being the one to control
the imagery of her current

64
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:21,549
relationship, she is reclaiming the
narrative. She is saying, I
am not a victim of

65
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,846
my circumstances; I am an
adult in a stable relationship.
However, I’ll throw a curveball

66
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:28,143
here. Some fans are skeptical
of Benny Blanco. They see
him as a departure from

67
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:31,440
her usual brand. Is this
a case of a celebrity
trying too hard to seem

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,518
relatable by dating someone who
is a bit more of
an eccentric, behind-the-scenes figure?

69
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:38,315
I think that is overthinking
it, Margaret. People in their
thirties just want someone who

70
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,612
shows up. If he is
a good partner and she
is happy, that contributes to

71
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,909
her professional stability. We see
it in every industry. When
your home life is settled,

72
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:48,206
your work life flourishes. Look
at her upcoming projects. She
is set to play Linda

73
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:51,504
Ronstadt in a biopic. That
is a role that requires
immense discipline. Ronstadt was a

74
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,801
powerhouse. If Gomez is going
to pull that off, she
needs to be in a

75
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,559
headspace where she isn't distracted
by tabloid drama.

76
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,356
The Linda Ronstadt project is
interesting because it bridges the
gap between her music past

77
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:03,653
and her acting future. But
let’s talk about the mental
health aspect. She has her

78
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:06,951
platform, Wondermind. In the last
few months, she has been
very vocal about the intersection

79
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:10,248
of mental health and the
workplace. She isn't just posting
platitudes; she is looking at

80
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:13,545
the economics of wellness. Gary,
you often talk about public
safety and the health of

81
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,842
our communities. Do you think
a celebrity-led mental health platform
actually moves the needle for

82
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,381
a family in Jersey City
or Brooklyn?

83
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,178
It moves the needle if
it de-stigmatizes the conversation. If
a guy working on the

84
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,475
docks or a woman running
a small business sees someone
with that much success admitting

85
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:28,772
they need help, it makes
it easier for them to
seek help too. It’s about

86
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:32,069
accountability to oneself. Now, I
want to go back to
the facts of the last

87
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,367
twenty-four hours. We have the
Instagram posts, we have the
ongoing buzz from the Emilia

88
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,664
Pérez trailer, and we have
the Rare Beauty expansion into
body care that is hitting

89
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:41,961
the UK markets more aggressively
this week. It seems like
she is firing on all

90
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:42,181
cylinders.

91
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,978
She is. And she is
doing it while navigating the
complexities of being a billionaire—or

92
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,275
near-billionaire—in a climate that is
increasingly hostile to extreme wealth.
She manages to stay likable.

93
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:52,572
That is a rare feat.
Most people who reach that
level of wealth become disconnected.

94
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,869
But she keeps her focus
on things like the Rare
Impact Fund, which aims to

95
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:59,166
raise one hundred million dollars
for mental health services. That
is a concrete goal. It

96
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,265
isn't just a vague promise.

97
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:04,063
That is the rule of
law in action, in a
way. You set a standard,

98
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:07,360
you create a fund, and
you hold yourself accountable to
the numbers. I like that.

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,657
I also like that she
is leaning into her heritage
with the Audiard film. It

100
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:13,954
is a Spanish-language role. For
a naturalized citizen like me,
seeing someone embrace their roots

101
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:17,251
while dominating the global stage
is significant. It shows that
the American dream isn't just

102
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,570
about assimilation; it is about
contribution.

103
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,367
It is a bold move,
especially since she has admitted
in the past that her

104
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,664
Spanish wasn't perfect. She put
in the work to be
able to perform in that

105
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,962
language for a major film.
That brings us back to
your favorite theme: the work.

106
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,259
But Gary, let me play
the devil’s advocate. Is there
a risk of overexposure? Between

107
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,556
the cooking shows, the beauty
brand, the hit TV show,
the movies, and the constant

108
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,974
social media updates, are we
reaching a Selena Gomez saturation
point?

109
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:41,771
There is always that risk.
But as long as the
quality stays high, people will

110
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:45,068
stay tuned. Only Murders in
the Building is a high-quality
production. It isn't cheap entertainment.

111
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:48,365
It is well-written and well-acted.
As long as she chooses
projects that have substance, she

112
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:51,662
avoids the "famous for being
famous" trap. She is famous
for being productive. That is

113
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:52,981
a distinction that matters to
me.

114
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:56,778
It’s a fair point. And
looking at the data from
the last twenty-four hours, the

115
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,076
sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. People
are responding to the "life
lately" posts with a sense

116
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,373
of relief. It’s like the
public has been rooting for
her to find this version

117
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:06,230
of herself. We are seeing
a shift from the "starlet"
to the "mogul."

118
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,027
And that is where we
should leave it. Whether you
are in South Brooklyn or

119
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:13,325
Central London, the story of
someone putting in the years,
facing their challenges head-on, and

120
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,622
coming out the other side
with a clear vision for
their future is a story

121
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:19,919
worth following. It is about
the long-term stability we all
strive for. Margaret, thanks for

122
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,358
the breakdown.

123
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:24,156
Any time, Gary. I’ll keep
an eye on the trades
to see if that Linda

124
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,255
Ronstadt filming schedule gets confirmed.

125
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:29,052
Sounds good. And I’ll go
check on the guinea pigs.
They probably need more hay.

126
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:32,349
To our listeners, stay grounded,
stay pragmatic, and we will
talk to you tomorrow. This

127
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,448
has been the morning briefing.
