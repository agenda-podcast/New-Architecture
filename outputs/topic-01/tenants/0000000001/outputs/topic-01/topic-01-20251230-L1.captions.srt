1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,889
Good morning from the studio.
It is Thursday, October 24,
2024. I am Gary Thompson.

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:05,777
I am coming to you
after a fairly standard commute
from South Brooklyn. The cats

3
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:08,666
were acting up this morning,
and the guinea pigs were
whistling for their carrots before

4
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,555
the sun was even up,
but we made it. My
kids are off to school,

5
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:14,444
and I am here in
Jersey City ready to look
at the news through a

6
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:17,332
lens of what actually matters
for the long term. Today,
we are talking about a

7
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:20,221
figure who has been in
the public eye for two
decades but seems to be

8
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:23,110
hitting a new gear of
professional maturity. We are talking
about Selena Gomez. Margaret, you

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,999
have been tracking the dispatches
coming out of Georgia over
the last twenty-four hours. What

10
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:26,576
is the latest?

11
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,965
Thanks, Gary. It has been
a very busy window for
Selena Gomez. Just yesterday, October

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,854
23, she was down in
Georgia for the SCAD Savannah
Film Festival. This is a

13
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:35,743
big stop on the awards
circuit, and she was there
to receive the Virtuoso Award.

14
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,631
This is specifically for her
performance in the new film
Emilia Pérez. It is a

15
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:41,520
Jacques Audiard film, a Spanish-language
musical about a cartel leader
who seeks gender-affirming surgery. Selena

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,409
plays Jessi, the wife of
the cartel leader. The buzz
coming out of Savannah is

17
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,298
intense. People are calling this
the definitive pivot in her
career. She was seen on

18
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,186
the red carpet in a
very understated, elegant black gown,
greeting fans, but the real

19
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:53,075
meat of the story is
the interview she gave regarding
her craft and her future.

20
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,464
You know, Margaret, I look
at someone like Selena Gomez
and I think about the

21
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:59,353
institutions of celebrity. We have
seen so many people who
start as child stars and

22
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:02,241
then the wheels come off
because there is no accountability
or no long-term plan. But

23
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:05,130
what I am seeing here,
especially with this Virtuoso Award
on October 23, is a

24
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,019
person who is treating her
career like a serious trade.
She is forty-three years old—wait,

25
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,908
no, I am forty-three, she
is thirty-two—but she has the
poise of someone who has

26
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:13,796
been working a steady job
for thirty years. She is
showing up, doing the work,

27
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:16,685
and now she is being
recognized by the film community,
not just the pop music

28
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:16,885
world.

29
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:20,274
It is interesting you mention
the work, Gary, because I
want to push back a

30
00:01:20,274 --> 00:01:23,163
little on the idea that
this is just a "steady
job." This film, Emilia Pérez,

31
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:26,051
is a massive risk. It
is a musical about the
Mexican cartel. She is singing

32
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,940
in Spanish. In her interviews
yesterday with The Hollywood Reporter
and Variety, she admitted that

33
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,829
she was terrified of the
role. She said she felt
she had to prove she

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,718
belonged in that space. Now,
as a skeptic, I have
to ask: is this Virtuoso

35
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,606
Award just part of a
very well-oiled Oscar campaign machine?
Netflix is pushing this film

36
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:40,495
hard. They have a release
date of November 13 coming
up. Is she actually a

37
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:43,191
virtuoso, or is she just
the most famous person in
a very artistic film?

38
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:46,580
That is a fair question,
Margaret. We have to distinguish
between the marketing and the

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,469
merit. But look at the
facts of the performance. She
is working with Jacques Audiard,

40
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,358
a director who does not
suffer fools. He is a
Palme d'Or winner. If she

41
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:55,246
did not have the chops,
she would not be in
the frame. What I appreciate,

42
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:58,135
from a pragmatic standpoint, is
that she is not resting
on her laurels. She has

43
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:01,024
the most followed Instagram account
for a woman, she has
a billion-dollar beauty brand in

44
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:03,913
Rare Beauty, and she could
easily just sit back and
collect checks. Instead, she is

45
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,801
in Savannah, Georgia, on a
Wednesday night, talking about the
technical challenges of singing in

46
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,690
her native language, which she
has admitted she had to
work hard to reclaim. That

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,423
shows a level of professional
accountability that I respect.

48
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,812
She did speak about that
specifically yesterday. She mentioned to
Entertainment Weekly that singing in

49
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:17,701
Spanish for this role was
a different kind of vulnerability.
It wasn't just about hitting

50
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:20,590
the notes; it was about
the character's pain. And she
linked that to her own

51
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,478
life. She has been very
open lately about her health
struggles and the fact that

52
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:26,367
she cannot carry her own
children. Some might say she
is oversharing, Gary. Is there

53
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,256
a point where the personal
brand and the professional work
become too blurred? Does knowing

54
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,145
about her medical history make
her a better actress, or
is it just part of

55
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:33,108
the modern celebrity industrial complex?

56
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:36,496
I will say, though, that
her fans in Savannah yesterday
did not seem to care

57
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:39,385
about the "industrial complex" part.
There are reports from the
Daily Mail and local outlets

58
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:42,274
that she spent a significant
amount of time with the
students at the Savannah College

59
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:45,163
of Art and Design. She
wasn't just there for the
trophy; she was doing a

60
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:48,051
masterclass. She told them that
vulnerability is a strength, not
a weakness. I find that

61
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,940
plausible, but also a bit
of a convenient narrative for
someone who is currently the

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,481
face of a "mental health
focused" beauty brand.

63
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:55,869
See, Margaret, this is where
we might disagree on the
"convenience" of it. I look

64
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,758
at it as a father.
I have three kids. I
want them to see people

65
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:01,647
in positions of power who
are honest about their limitations.
If she is using her

66
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,536
platform to say, "Hey, I
have these health issues, I
have these struggles, but I

67
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,424
am still showing up to
work and winning awards," that
provides a stable roadmap for

68
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:10,313
young people. It is not
extremist; it is just human.
And the fact that she

69
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:13,202
is doing this while her
show, Only Murders in the
Building, is wrapping up another

70
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:16,091
successful season shows she is
managing multiple high-level responsibilities. That
is a lot of balls

71
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,631
to keep in the air
without dropping them.

72
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,020
Let's talk about the Oscar
buzz specifically, because that was
a major theme in the

73
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,909
Rolling Stone and Variety pieces
from the last twenty-four hours.
The critics are placing her

74
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,798
firmly in the Supporting Actress
race. If she gets the
nomination, she becomes one of

75
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:29,686
the few Disney alumni to
really cross over into that
top-tier Academy circle. But Gary,

76
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:32,575
the film is a musical.
Some critics at the BBC
have noted that the genre-bending

77
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,464
nature of Emilia Pérez might
be too "out there" for
the traditional Academy voters. Do

78
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:38,353
you think her public image,
which is very grounded and
"plainspoken" as you like to

79
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,241
say, helps bridge that gap
for a movie that is
essentially a French-directed Mexican cartel

80
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:41,441
musical?

81
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:44,830
I think it does. People
trust her. They feel they
know her. In a world

82
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,719
where everything feels like an
act, her brand of "lived
experience" feels authentic to people.

83
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,608
Whether it is 100% authentic
or 80% authentic doesn't matter
as much as the fact

84
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:53,496
that it functions as a
stabilizing force in her career.
She isn't chasing trends. She

85
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:56,385
isn't trying to be a
"diva." She is in Savannah
talking to film students. That

86
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:59,274
is a very "working class"
approach to being a global
superstar. She is putting in

87
00:03:59,274 --> 00:03:59,659
the hours.

88
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,048
I will concede that the
Rare Impact Fund, which she
also discussed yesterday, is a

89
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,937
concrete institution. It is not
just a hashtag. They are
actually putting money into mental

90
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:08,825
health services in schools. That
aligns with your value of
institutions, Gary. She is building

91
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,714
something that outlasts a movie's
theatrical run. However, I do
wonder if the pressure of

92
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:14,603
being this "perfectly vulnerable" role
model is sustainable. She mentioned
in The Hollywood Reporter yesterday

93
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:17,492
that she sometimes feels the
weight of everyone's expectations. She
said, and I am paraphrasing,

94
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:20,380
that she has to be
careful not to lose herself
in the "Selena Gomez" of

95
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,765
it all.

96
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:24,154
That is the risk of
the job. But look at
the alternative. We see so

97
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:27,043
many people in her position
who flame out because they
have no foundation. She has

98
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:29,932
her family, she has her
business, and she has a
clear sense of her own

99
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:32,820
limitations. To me, that is
the definition of a virtuoso—not
just someone who is good

100
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,709
at their craft, but someone
who understands the instrument they
are playing, which in this

101
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,057
case is her own life
and career.

102
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:40,446
It is a compelling argument.
And the timing is perfect.
With the Savannah Film Festival

103
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,335
giving her this platform right
now, she is effectively kicking
off the final sprint for

104
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:46,224
the year. We have the
Netflix release in three weeks.
We have the soundtrack for

105
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,112
Emilia Pérez which is already
getting traction on Billboard. She
is effectively dominating the film,

106
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:50,653
music, and business news cycles
simultaneously this morning.

107
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:54,042
And she is doing it
without a scandal. In this
day and age, that is

108
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,930
a feat in itself. No
extremism, no public meltdowns, just
a professional at the top

109
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,819
of her game receiving an
award in Georgia. It is
a reminder that long-term stability

110
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,708
comes from consistent work and
a bit of humility. Margaret,
I think we have defined

111
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,597
the standard here. She is
setting a bar for how
to transition from a teen

112
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,137
idol to a serious institutional
player in Hollywood.

113
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:10,526
I agree with that. Even
a skeptic like me has
to admit that the sheer

114
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,415
volume of her output, and
the quality of the collaborators
she is choosing, suggests this

115
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:16,304
isn't a fluke. It is
a calculated, well-executed career phase.
Whether the Oscar comes or

116
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:18,615
not, the Virtuoso Award she
picked up yesterday marks a
turning point.

117
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:22,003
Well said. To summarize for
our listeners: Selena Gomez was
in Savannah, Georgia, on October

118
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,892
23, 2024, to receive the
Virtuoso Award for her role
in Emilia Pérez. She is

119
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,781
navigating a heavy awards season
while maintaining her business interests
and being open about her

120
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:30,670
personal health challenges. It is
a masterclass in professional management.
We will be watching how

121
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,558
the public responds when the
film hits Netflix on November
13. That is our deep

122
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,099
dive for this morning. I
am Gary Thompson.

123
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,510
And I am Margaret Butcher.
We will see you tomorrow.
