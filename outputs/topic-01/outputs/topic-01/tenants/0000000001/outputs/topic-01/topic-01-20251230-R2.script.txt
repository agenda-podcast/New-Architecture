Gary Thompson: We are looking at Selena Gomez today, who seems to have found a perfect balance between her business empire and her personal life.
Margaret Butcher: It is a fascinating evolution, Gary. Her company, Rare Beauty, is now valued at approximately two billion dollars. She has resisted selling it, showing she is focused on long-term growth rather than a quick payday.
Gary Thompson: That level of institutional thinking is rare in the celebrity world. She is also using her platform for something substantial with Wondermind.
Margaret Butcher: Yes, she is very vocal about mental health advocacy. Her Rare Impact Fund has a goal of raising one hundred million dollars for services. It is about de-stigmatizing the conversation for everyone.
Gary Thompson: And she is still very active in her craft. The buzz from Cannes for Emilia Pérez is huge.
Margaret Butcher: It really is. She shared a Best Actress ensemble award there. She is also preparing to play Linda Ronstadt in an upcoming biopic. Between that and Only Murders in the Building Season 4 returning August 27th, her schedule is packed.
Gary Thompson: Yet, she still finds time for her personal life, sharing new photos with boyfriend Benny Blanco just yesterday.
Margaret Butcher: She is truly happy.
