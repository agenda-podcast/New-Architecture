Gary Thompson: Selena Gomez is dominating headlines today with a mix of personal joy and professional triumphs. Margaret, what is the latest from her social media?
Margaret Butcher: Gary, Selena shared a "life lately" update June 17th, featuring sweet photos with boyfriend Benny Blanco. It shows a stable chapter for her. But the real news is her career momentum. She recently shared the Best Actress ensemble prize at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in the musical noir Emilia Pérez.
Gary Thompson: That is a significant shift from her pop roots. It seems she is leaning into serious acting and producing now.
Margaret Butcher: Exactly. She mentioned having perhaps one more album left before focusing on acting full-time. Plus, Only Murders in the Building Season 4 premieres August 27th. The production even moved to Los Angeles this time.
Gary Thompson: She is also a powerhouse in business. Rare Beauty is now valued near two billion dollars.
Margaret Butcher: It is incredible. She is set to produce and star in the Linda Ronstadt biopic, bridging her musical past with her cinematic future. She is building long-term equity while maintaining her mental health advocacy through her platform, Wondermind. She is firing on all cylinders right now, Gary.
