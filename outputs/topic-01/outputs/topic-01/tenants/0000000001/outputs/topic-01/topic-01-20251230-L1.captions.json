      "text": "Good morning from a slightly humid South Brooklyn. I am Gary Thompson, and you are listening to the morning briefing. I just finished my commute over to Jersey City, and I have to tell you, the PATH train was packed today, but it gave me some time to catch up on the headlines. Before we dive into the heavy lifting of the day, I was checking in on my guinea pigs, Pesto and Beans, and I realized that even in a quiet house with two cats and three kids, there is a certain rhythm to life that we all try to maintain. Stability is something I talk about a lot on this show. It is the bedrock of a functioning society and a functioning life. And that brings me to our topic today. We are looking at someone who has been in the public eye for two decades and seems to have finally found a balance between her professional output and her personal stability. I am talking about Selena Gomez. Margaret, you have been tracking the social media movements and the trade reports over the last twenty-four hours. What is the latest on the Gomez front?"

      "text": "It is a busy window for her, Gary. If you looked at Instagram late last night, June 17th, or early this morning, June 18th, you would have seen what she is calling a life lately update. It is a series of photos that really leans into her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco. Now, I know you usually prefer to stick to the hard economic data or the rule of law, but in the world of entertainment and brand management, these personal glimpses are strategic assets. We are seeing her very publicly happy, which is a sharp contrast to the narrative of struggle that defined her mid-twenties. But beyond the domestic bliss, we have some very real movement on her film career and her business empire, Rare Beauty."

    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Let us start with the work. I have always said that accountability in your profession is what earns you a seat at the table. Gomez started as a child actor, moved into pop music, and now she is being taken very seriously in rooms that used to ignore her. The buzz from the Cannes Film Festival is still echoing. She shared a Best Actress ensemble prize for Emilia Pérez. That is a Jacques Audiard film, a musical noir about a Mexican cartel leader. That is a long way from the Disney Channel, Margaret."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "It is a massive pivot. And I will play the skeptic here for a second, Gary. Is she a great actress, or is she a great celebrity who fits a specific mold for international directors looking for American distribution? The film Emilia Pérez was the talk of Cannes back in May, and the momentum hasn't slowed down. Critics are saying this is her career-best performance. But we have to ask, is this a one-off, or is she actually transitioning away from being a pop star? She told the press recently that she feels she has one more album in her before she wants to settle into acting full-time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "I respect that. There is a pragmatism in knowing when to shift gears. In my line of work, and in the lives of the working families I talk to in Brooklyn, you have to know when a certain chapter is closing so you can invest in the next one. If she stays in music just for the sake of the charts, she risks burnout. If she moves into acting and producing—like she does with Only Murders in the Building—she is building long-term equity. Speaking of that show, we have a confirmed date for Season 4, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "We do. August 27th. The production has moved to Los Angeles for part of the season, which is a big change for a show that is so rooted in New York. But back to your point about equity, Gary. Let’s look at Rare Beauty. There were reports earlier this year, and reinforced in recent Forbes analysis, that the company is being valued in the two-billion-dollar range. She has resisted the urge to sell it off quickly. That shows a level of institutional thinking that you usually appreciate. She isn't just looking for a quick payday; she’s building a brand that has stayed relevant for four years, which is an eternity in the celebrity makeup world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "It is about the product. My wife uses some of those products, and she isn't someone who buys into celebrity hype. She buys it because it works and it is priced for people who actually have a budget. That is the kind of business model that survives a recession. It is grounded. Now, Margaret, you mentioned those photos with Benny Blanco. You called them strategic. Explain that to me. I see a woman in her thirties posting photos with her boyfriend. Why is that a news item for us today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "Because in the last twenty-four hours, those photos have generated millions of engagements. In the digital economy, engagement is currency. But there is a deeper layer. For years, the public narrative around Selena Gomez was tied to her ex-partners or her health struggles—her lupus diagnosis and her kidney transplant. By being the one to control the imagery of her current relationship, she is reclaiming the narrative. She is saying, I am not a victim of my circumstances; I am an adult in a stable relationship. However, I’ll throw a curveball here. Some fans are skeptical of Benny Blanco. They see him as a departure from her usual brand. Is this a case of a celebrity trying too hard to seem relatable by dating someone who is a bit more of an eccentric, behind-the-scenes figure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "I think that is overthinking it, Margaret. People in their thirties just want someone who shows up. If he is a good partner and she is happy, that contributes to her professional stability. We see it in every industry. When your home life is settled, your work life flourishes. Look at her upcoming projects. She is set to play Linda Ronstadt in a biopic. That is a role that requires immense discipline. Ronstadt was a powerhouse. If Gomez is going to pull that off, she needs to be in a headspace where she isn't distracted by tabloid drama."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "The Linda Ronstadt project is interesting because it bridges the gap between her music past and her acting future. But let’s talk about the mental health aspect. She has her platform, Wondermind. In the last few months, she has been very vocal about the intersection of mental health and the workplace. She isn't just posting platitudes; she is looking at the economics of wellness. Gary, you often talk about public safety and the health of our communities. Do you think a celebrity-led mental health platform actually moves the needle for a family in Jersey City or Brooklyn?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "It moves the needle if it de-stigmatizes the conversation. If a guy working on the docks or a woman running a small business sees someone with that much success admitting they need help, it makes it easier for them to seek help too. It’s about accountability to oneself. Now, I want to go back to the facts of the last twenty-four hours. We have the Instagram posts, we have the ongoing buzz from the Emilia Pérez trailer, and we have the Rare Beauty expansion into body care that is hitting the UK markets more aggressively this week. It seems like she is firing on all cylinders."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "She is. And she is doing it while navigating the complexities of being a billionaire—or near-billionaire—in a climate that is increasingly hostile to extreme wealth. She manages to stay likable. That is a rare feat. Most people who reach that level of wealth become disconnected. But she keeps her focus on things like the Rare Impact Fund, which aims to raise one hundred million dollars for mental health services. That is a concrete goal. It isn't just a vague promise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "That is the rule of law in action, in a way. You set a standard, you create a fund, and you hold yourself accountable to the numbers. I like that. I also like that she is leaning into her heritage with the Audiard film. It is a Spanish-language role. For a naturalized citizen like me, seeing someone embrace their roots while dominating the global stage is significant. It shows that the American dream isn't just about assimilation; it is about contribution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "It is a bold move, especially since she has admitted in the past that her Spanish wasn't perfect. She put in the work to be able to perform in that language for a major film. That brings us back to your favorite theme: the work. But Gary, let me play the devil’s advocate. Is there a risk of overexposure? Between the cooking shows, the beauty brand, the hit TV show, the movies, and the constant social media updates, are we reaching a Selena Gomez saturation point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "There is always that risk. But as long as the quality stays high, people will stay tuned. Only Murders in the Building is a high-quality production. It isn't cheap entertainment. It is well-written and well-acted. As long as she chooses projects that have substance, she avoids the \"famous for being famous\" trap. She is famous for being productive. That is a distinction that matters to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "It’s a fair point. And looking at the data from the last twenty-four hours, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. People are responding to the \"life lately\" posts with a sense of relief. It’s like the public has been rooting for her to find this version of herself. We are seeing a shift from the \"starlet\" to the \"mogul.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "And that is where we should leave it. Whether you are in South Brooklyn or Central London, the story of someone putting in the years, facing their challenges head-on, and coming out the other side with a clear vision for their future is a story worth following. It is about the long-term stability we all strive for. Margaret, thanks for the breakdown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "text": "Any time, Gary. I’ll keep an eye on the trades to see if that Linda Ronstadt filming schedule gets confirmed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "text": "Sounds good. And I’ll go check on the guinea pigs. They probably need more hay. To our listeners, stay grounded, stay pragmatic, and we will talk to you tomorrow. This has been the morning briefing."
