00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,738
Welcome back. Today we are
diving into the global cost
of living crisis that is

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,686
squeezing households everywhere.

3
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:10,925
It is a tough reality.
Prices for housing, food, energy,
and services are rising much

4
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:12,820
faster than wages can keep
up.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,059
Exactly. We see inflation driven
by complex policy decisions and
major supply shocks affecting every

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,954
corner of the globe right
now.

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:25,192
Working families are feeling the
pressure. When the cost of
basic necessities spikes, the monthly

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,404
budget simply does not stretch
far enough.

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,642
So, what caused this? We
are looking at a mix
of supply chain disruptions and

10
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:34,538
shifts in global economic policy
lately.

11
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:39,776
These supply shocks have made
energy and food particularly expensive,
which then trickles down into

12
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:41,672
the cost of almost every
service.

13
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:46,910
What can families realistically expect
next? Is there any relief
on the horizon or should

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,805
we prepare for more of
this?

15
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:54,044
Experts suggest that while some
volatility might settle, the high
price floor for housing and

16
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:55,939
energy could remain for a
while.

17
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,178
To cope now, families are
forced to prioritize essential spending
and look for any possible

18
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,073
ways to reduce their energy
consumption.

19
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:04,521
It is survival.
